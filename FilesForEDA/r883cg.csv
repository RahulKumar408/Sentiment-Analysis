Put 2 and 2 together (along with even a general understanding of the Quran) and it's easy to conclude that no, there is supposed to be no punishment for blasphemy alone. All punishments for ""blasphemy"" during the Prophet's time involved characters that involved in other heinous crimes against Muslims.

hnlusd2,t1_hn4fz4t,"Agree. Majority of terrorism is associated with Islam whether it's real or not. I'm a Sri Lankan and 2019 Muslim extremists killed over 250 people here by bombing. They attacked Catholics and foreigners. They had plans to attack us, Buddhists too. They thought they would go to heaven by doing that. I don't know if I'm wrong, but my Muslim friend said in the Quran its stated that non believers were killed in a certain war in the past. But these people misinterpreted as it's a good thing to kill non muslims now too. 

I mean in Buddhism harming other's is never justified. It's a sin to intentionally harm another even as a self defence. There is not a word in Buddhist scripts that can be misinterpreted as harming others is ever okay. Not like quran. 
Of course, in today's world there are people who identify as buddists harm others too. They do it because of their own mentality. The religion has nothing to do with it. They don't think they would go to heaven and have all these virgins. 

When they interviewed one of the suicide bombers' family, they said their son became more religious close to the attack. My friend's dad who is also a Muslim he get criticised from his family for not being so religious when he is one of the good people I've ever met. If there's a heaven, he is the one to go there. So from these two cases what I understood was if you know a Muslim who started to become more and more religious you should definitely stay away from them. I don't see people like that in other religions. Eventhough some extremely religious people can be annoying, they are not scary (at least the majority).

>why would pakistan be a muslim country not like it was muslims that live there

So, is turkey a muslim country? It is muslim majority and calls itself secular. Is it or is it not an ""islamic"" country like pakistan?


>not like islam that showed us how to maintain our societies and the best things for them.

Pretty sure we have a constitution that is written in english and most laws are copied from the british empire.

Also, we got ""democracy"" from the british/west. And we wear pant shirt (western clothes), even your railway tracks were made by the british.


>Plus most muslims didnt leave to go to foreign lands for islam we all know why the majority left it was for money the west had a high valued currency and cushy lives

Yes, how dare they de restsire for their families to live a better life in a foreign land, they should like us in our own land. 


>pakistanis that left saw the kaafir nations as being better then an islamic one

I mean... They are better than most ""islamic nations"".

Let's just compare pakistan with norway. 



Pakistan

People die of hunger. 

Women are discouraged from holding jobs.

Corruption and bribery is rampant.

People get killed for saying anything wrong by a mob.

Terrorism is high.

Food mixed with chemicals


Norway

People do not die of hunger, government usually has social programs for the poor.

Women are encouraged to hold old jobs.

Corruption and bribery is not rampant

People don't get killed for saying anything wrong by a mob.

Terrorism is almost non-existent.

Food is clean and is not mixed with any chemicals.


>its better to die as a muslim in a poor country then a muslim chasing earthly desires

Some Muslims chase earthly desires in every country they live in, others don't chase earthly desires no matter which country they live in.

It has nothing to do with the country. What, now i can't go to norway because my faith is so weak that once i see alcohol and women, i will become alcoholic and rapist? Stop believing the people around you and think!


>we have our own islamic nations and we should try to fix muslims problems

Best way to fix those problems is either 

-become the prime minister and try and fail like IK

Which you can't even try in your most ""islamic"" country Saudi Arabia.

-or leave the country learn about islam and teach it to muslims and non-muslims alike.

It isn't an average muslim's duty to fix islamic nations.

Average muslims duty is to god and god tells people to  teach islam and do good.


Muslim empire was destroyed in the 13th century. Ottoman empire was destroyed in 20th century. 
Empires/countries come and go but islam remains.

And that is what matters.

>not like most the people in this group who dont even understand the problems they caused for their children and probably never will.

Because of the problems they understood, they left. People die/ get oppressed/ forced to pay bribes. Much more frequently in pakistan than in norway.

It is completely understandable if they want to leave.



P.S 
I am muslim myself.
 ""Islam is perfect but muslims are not"" 
Calling anything islamic doesn't make it one. 

Islamic society is one where islam is followed most closely. And people desire to move to that society.

A country like norway may not call itself islamic but it is more closer to an islamic society than pakistan is.

Most illegal things are also sins for muslims.

And norway is more successful in most of them than most islamic nations.

Killing, raping, molesting, bribing, corruption, care for people who are addicted to drugs and need help, suicide, etc etc ... Etc

All you hear is they have alochol, lgbtq, sex before marriage, women wearing few clothes.

But have you ever thought that maybe none of that matters if your faith is strong. 

Nobody forces you to drink alcohol, become gay, have sex before marriage, wear bikini and go beaches as women.

A child who came between her legs was smeared with the blood that was there. When the morning came, the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed about it.

He assembled the people and said: I adjure by Allah the man who has done this action and I adjure him by my right to him that he should stand up. Jumping over the necks of the people and trembling the man stood up.

He sat before the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah! I am her master; she used to abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not abandon her habit. I have two sons like pearls from her, and she was my companion. Last night she began to abuse and disparage you. So I took a dagger, put it on her belly and pressed it till I killed her.

Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Oh be witness, no retaliation is payable for her blood.""

Both are religious and historical texts.  The Quran was transmitted by the companions of the Prophet pbuh, same as the Hadiths. They both are important, though to us Muslims the Quran holds more weight.

>Blind faith on the work of scholars 1000 years ago.

It's not blind faith. There is literally a topic called the ""Science of Hadith"". The scholars of the past did most of our works for us. Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim scrutinised any and all narrations, and they had a very detailed process of whether they wanted to include a Hadith in their collection. That is why Hadiths from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are considered authentic to the highest level by all scholars because of their rigorous process. Any Hadith which had even the slightest of doubt was not included in their collections.

The scholars of the past were highly intellectual, even more than the scholarship we have today.They documented everything. That is why their works are still referenced today, and FYI, they are scrutinised and re-evaluation by Islamic scholarship. You can simply talk to an Islamic scholar with a degree in Islamic studies, and they will inform you.

If you ask any sane scholar of Islam, they will explain to you the context of those hadiths,  there's a level of politics involved as well. People who appostated during those times, did so with the intention of treason or to encourage apostasy, all with the intention to harm the Islamic State. In that context, why shouldn't the punishment of treason be death? The punishment for treason in every country today is death.

I would encourage you to look into the Science of Hadiths. It seems you are a bit out of touch with how Islamic scholarship is actually being conducted.

In my view, the problem is that people are uneducated and listen to ""scholars"" who have absolutely no credentials, who take these Hadiths / Quranic text out of context to fit their agenda.

hnkav9q,t1_hng316v,"Because Bukhari was a quote collector. His primary aim was to collect as many narrations as he can and list out the chain of transmission. He wasn't interested in arguing the merit of the quotes based on substance. So he collected whatever he could, even narrations which contradict each other.

Nisai was a quote aggregator. He had two sides, a collector side and a scholarly side. He curated based on tranmission merit, but also argued merit based on substance. But sides were kept separate, as was the tradition of the time. He was very gung-ho though, and got stoned by a mob for openly cursing the Ummayad dynasty. So if you'd ask him, he wouldn't consider these narrations to have merit as well. 

History is fun when you realize different people have different perspectives of an event. But it can get dangerous when people take narrations as canon and misuse them. I will give you an example:

The first narration you mentioned is by Ikramah right. Ikramah, along with Ibn Abi Sarh, was one of the only 10 people ordered to be killed during at the [conquest of Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Mecca#Aftermath). Him and Sarh ends up participating the murder of Uthman, and then Ikramah makes claim about Ali burning apostates now this narration is used by extremists.

Now according to sources, either 2, 1, or 0 out of 10 people end up actually be killed after the conquest of Mecca. Stark contrast, but it just shows that people like Nisai and Bukhari did their job. They didn't make the decision for us to gauge history. They collected everything and left it for people to decide what happened. We have narrations about each one of the people. 

One of the narration states that a singing girl of Al-Maqis was killed who incited war against Medina. Another narration states that after the battle of Badr, people stopped listening to this girl, so she traveled to Medina to ask for monetary help from Muhammad. Muhammad asked him if business was bad, and she said that the loss of Badr and death of Abu Lahb had dried up all streams. So he ordered people to collect grain for her. She collected it and took it back to Makkah where she continued her profession. Ibn Hisham states this and he takes it from Ibn Ishaq, who took it from Aban. But Nisai argues, that there is no way these two statements go together. 

Anyways this is getting long. Point is, history often has multiple sides. We don't have verified single source of information about the events back then. We have multiple. So we can't use it as canon.",7,2,1638857571.0

hn6t01d,t1_hn6isgm,">The reality is that more than a billion Muslims believe that blasphemers should be punished (a lot of them, by death).Do you think that billion+ of these Muslims don't have any proof/basis for their belief?What about punishments less harsher than death? Do you believe Islam sanctions them for blasphemers?

I asked for proof with regards to ""Islam allows killing innocent non-muslims or apostates"" because this is a non-sense claim, and no true muslim believes in this non-sense.

With regards to Blasphemy (which is different from apostasy).

In an Islamic state, you are not allowed publicly mock Islam and disrespect Prophet PBUH. Public provocation in the lands of Islam is not allowed. That in Islamic Law is what is considered Blasphemy, if you intentionally publicly verbally abuse the Prophet PBUH or anything against Islam.

One of the purpose of an Islamic state is that the society is not indulging in things which are considered immoral in Islam, for that reason in Islamic Law does not believe in absolute free speech, where you are able to publicly verbally abuse things that people hold dear to themselves, regardless of who you are (Muslim/Non-Muslim) A muslim insulting a Christian or a Jew would also not be allowed.

  


With regards to the punishment, There is a difference if provocation comes from a Muslim vs a non-muslim but in general, whoever commits public deliberate Blasphemy has to be tried by the authorities and the court system, to determine the details of the case (Is he mentally ok? Does he know what he is saying etc.).

He is of course then able to defend himself. If the conclusion of the court is that it was intentional deliberate provocation knowing the consequences, then the majority position of scholars is that punishment for that is indeed execution.

Some scholars (Hanafi) scholars deem this punishment for Muslims only, for Non-Muslims living in an Islamic state, they are to be punished but not killed.

>What about punishments less harsher than death?

With regards to the extent of the punishment, It's all dependent on our moral systems. In Islamic law, public verbal abuse against Islam and the Prophet PBUH is extremely immoral, which might not be the case for you.

Incest is considered immoral and illegal in many places, even western societies, and the punishment for Incest is ""Punishable by five years' to life imprisonment,""

To someone who believes there is nothing wrong with Incest, these laws may be too extreme. So whose morals systems are we suppose to follow? Yours? Western Secular morals? Or the guy who thinks Incest is good? You see the problem with using your morality to judge others? What you deem right and wrong is not necessarily what the other person thinks is right and wrong.

In a democracy, the moral system of a country is dependent on what the majority deem moral and immoral. In an Islamic state, the moral system is dependent on what God has deemed moral and immoral based on scripture.",7,8,1638621254.0

hn6rt7f,t1_hn6im17,"First of all, I am thankful that you are staying respectful. As you can imagine, a lot of ex-muslims straight out hate on Islam.

>So are you denying that Islam calls for the killing of apostates then?

Yes Indeed, I am denying this. The Quran is actually against apostasy.

""Allah will neither forgive nor show the right way to those who believed, and then disbelieved, then believed, and again disbelieved, and thenceforth became ever more intense in their disbelief."" Quran 4:137

If punishment of apostasy was death, it would be impossible to believe again after disbelief, as they would have been put to death after the first disbelief. You will perhaps find Hadiths about Apostasy, but you should be careful and very importantly read their contexts. Apostasy during that time meant more than just ""I dont believe in Islam"", it was done for intention of harming the Islamic state (treason). Religion and politics during that time were intertwined, so if someone became an apostate, they did so to side with the enemy of the state. Treason as far as I know is punishable by death in almost all countries.

Now to address the Hadith (Sunan Abi Dawud 4361) with regards to Blasphemy.

This story is indicative of the justice with which the Muslims dealt with the people of the Book. The rights of the Jews who had entered into a treaty with the Muslims were guaranteed and protected, and it was not permissible to transgress against them by annoying them or harming them in any way. Hence when the people found a Jewish woman who had been slain, they were upset and they referred the matter to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who had given them that covenant and promise of safety, and had not taken the jizyah from them. He got angry and adjured the Muslims by Allaah that the one who had done this deed should show himself, so that he might determine his punishment and issue a ruling concerning him. But when he found out that she had broken the covenant time after time, by insulting the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and reviling him, all her rights were denied, and she deserved the punishment of execution which Shariah imposes on everyone who reviles the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), whether he is a Muslim or a dhimmi  because transgressing against the status of the Prophets is disbelief in Allah, and it invalidates every sanctity, right and covenant/contract; it is a major betrayal to the Islamic state, because they would be in clear violation of the contract.

In an Islamic state, you are not allowed publicly mock Islam and disrespect Prophet PBUH. Public provocation in the lands of Islam is not allowed. That in Islamic Law is what is considered Blasphemy, if you intentionally publicly verbally abuse the Prophet PBUH or anything against Islam.  There is of course difference between verbally abusing / deliberate provocation compared to having a discussion. One of the purpose of an Islamic state is indeed that the society is not indulging in things which are considered immoral in Islam, for that reason in Islamic Law does not believe in absolute free speech, where you are able to publicly verbally abuse things that people hold dear to themselves, regardless of who you are.

With regards to the punishment. There is a difference if provocation comes from a Muslim vs a non-muslim but in general, whoever commits public deliberate Blasphemy has to be tried by the authorities and the court system, to determine the details of the case (Is he mentally ok? Does he know what he is saying etc.).He is of course then able to defend himself. If the conclusion of the court is that it was intentional deliberate provocation knowing the consequences, then the  majority position of scholars is that punishment for that is indeed execution.

Some scholars (Hanafi) scholars deem this punishment for Muslims only, for Non-Muslims living in an Islamic state, they are to be punished but not killed.

I encourage you, whatever your reasons were that you be more fair in your research, and see if there is an explanation for these Hadiths from ***actual*** scholars. It's not enough for you to read these Hadiths and take them out of context. There was no difference between religion and politics during that time, so it was always the case, that if someone left Islam, they did so with the intention to harm the Muslims (Which is documented)

>Spare the treason line, heard it before and it doesn't make it better. You guys seriously don't realize that it makes an Islamic state actually existing look way worse rather than way better.

Scholars differentiate between **major** & **minor** apostasy. Hadiths need to be contextualised. The key difference between the two is treason or helping enemies attack Muslims. During the time of the Prophet PBUH, not a single person was killed for leaving Islam. Neither of which are punishable by death  
p.s. When AbdAllah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi'l Sarh (Uthman's bosom brother) apostated - and after having been Muslim and scribe of the Prophet pbuh - he went to the enemy side and conducted a media war against the Muslims (he was a poet, poetry was how information was spread). When he was vulnerable, Uthman ibn Affan interceded and and offered him protection. The Prophet pbuh accepted it and pardoned him (he later became Muslim again). See [Dr. Jonathan Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp9K3qlcE4I)'s take on the issue  
p.p.s. Interestingly, it was the pagans who first accused the Muslims of being apostates.

You're okay with them lynching him like this if he really had did those things?

The Hadith that was quoted was one time scenario, does not entail at all that people should take law into their own hands. You will not find a single Islamic scholar which would agree with you with regards to this

No what happened in Sialkot was disgusting (Since I've heard he only took down TTP poster) the people taking law in their hands should never be done, it is not allowed in Islam. Blasphemy law is to only be applied as far as I know if someone verbally abuses Islam and/or the Prophet PBUH  with the intention of driving people away from Islam, and with the intention to divide the society in an Islamic society- and this has to be carried out by court to determine if the person truly is guilty of doing this and scholars have in many cases allowed  Blasphemer a chance to reflect on ones mistake and take the said words back (as demonstrated by cases in history, whenever this happened) - and yes it is then justified in an Islamic state, if the person was found guilty.

TLDR: There is a distinction  
\- **Minor apostasy** is when someone embraces Islam and later leaves the religion peacefully without causing harm to the community. The sin is purely between the apostate and his Lord, and worldly punishments are not applied in this case.

**- Major apostasy** is when a person embraces Islam and later leaves the religion while combining this with the political crime of treason. Legal punishment against such persons can only be carried out by a lawful authority according to due process, and it is not permissible for individual Muslims to carry out this punishment on their own.
