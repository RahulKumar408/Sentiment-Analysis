f6rugfs,t3_dsv41j,"Indian farmers are partly to blame for the smog. Not that our farmers don't do the same. It's a quick and effortless way to get rid of crops. Any other methods require expense and effort. And we both don't have the best economy for this. So, we both burn them. It's just in their case that the wind currents carry it over our side. And especially during winter, the air being denser will stay closer to the surface while it's moving. The density also results in the increased intensity of smog. This same reason applies to Delhi also being very polluted. Unless we both get rid of these practices, nothing is going to change and the smog will just come back every winter.",0,30,1573119626.0
