fs67pmv,t3_gsfsyi,"Time to finally get it off my chest 

Another thing these dramas are lacking is the uninspired camera work. I don't know anyone in the industry but I doubt these people have a DOP. Literally every single scene is shot like a stage drama. After a scene end the characters stand in silence and there the musical cue to transition into the next scene which is usually just another scene where characters are sitting down and have a brief conversation and this loops until the episode ends. They always use wide angle shots in someone's cramped ass tv lounge that they rented it's so damn lazy. Not to mention alot of our actors don't talk naturally especially the young ones who are only in it for their looks. I have not seen a single drama where we actually get to know about the characters and their lives outside of the basic plot. There has never been a single throwaway line in the dramas that tells us that these are real people who converse naturally with others. The same actors play the same characters in almost every drama to the point where i can't even recognize what drama it is from just one scene alone when my parents are watching.",0,13,1590731337.0
