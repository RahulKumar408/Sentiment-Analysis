fnpomm9,t3_g2yl7d,"I love the clean-cut look! One suggestion: try matching the HSL/RGB values of the green to the official colors of the Pakistani flag and seeing how it looks (according to Wikipedia, it's RGB: 1/65/28 or hex #01411C). As it is, I think the logo has more luminosity and a slightly different hue than the flag... which the logo doesn't *have* to match, it would just be interesting to see how it looks.
