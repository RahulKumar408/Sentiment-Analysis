Just to be clear: It was poor governance rather than the export of vaccine that was responsible. Everyone knew it would take time to vaccinate the population and, even then, there is a risk of variants. 

We are all interdependent so above thinking about stopping exports, except perhaps for limited periods, does more harm. For instance, AZ vaccine has been produced under license and part of the contract is to supply to other countries including ones that produced the intellectual property such as the UK.

Also, what I am saying is that each and every one of those 1.4 billion people living in India don't deserve what is happening. You are no one to ""judge"" divine intervention. You have to go with, India this and India that, or Kashmir this, Kashmir that, but why can't you just be human? Not all of the people living there sent Pakistan death wishes, or boasted about the vaccine so why hate all. Its a fucking tragedy that you can't look an inch past what is happening in Kashmir or on Twitter. Last week, on average, an Indian person was dying every 5 minutes. Now are you telling me, that there were no good people who died? There is a village named Kartarpur in India that has Sikh inhabitants. It was originally a Muslim village but they fled after partition. The people that moved there saw the graves and knew that they must do something. To this day, they are maintaining the graves left by the Muslim families by using Muslim traditions and following Muslim practices. But, to you, these people are just another Indian who deserved your so called ""divine intervention"" and all of them personally travelled to Kashmir and spat on the peoples faces, beat them and called them names. Is that it? Is that why you hate them as well? Is that well deserved? Apparently, they deserved your ""divine intervention"" because they are terrible, sick people who had it coming. Grow up.

gvup8d7,t1_gvu18yg,"I was mentioning historical ties with India here. Not familial ones.

&#x200B;

Remember not so long ago (70ish years) Indo-Pak was a single country and before that, Punjab and Sindh especially as well as KP had access and a cultural similitude with India. 

&#x200B;

The status of Farsi was like the status of English currently: a 'court' language spoken by the Ashraaf muslim (and even elite Hindu) families. The British banned it being taught and replaced English with it, and they did so brutally. Even so, too few remnants of it have survived for it to have been a common person's language. Farsi was, thus, predominantly a language of the elite mughal-era families, and an additional language taught in the many Madaaris of the subcontinent. 

&#x200B;

Converting your 90% estimate on its head, most of Pakistanis share little to no familial and lingualistic ties to Afghans or Turks, and this includes regions like Balochistan and KPK. On the other hand, the cities and vilages on the border have a lot of present day ties to the cities on the other side (India). One can say that the region of present day Pakistan is not separate from the larger subcontinent in any coherent terms, we were/are similar. The difference is not historical, but rather has been politically constructed to build a nation, which was a pragmatic requirement in our formative years. 

This is the same with India, of course, wherein it has rarely been a united whole, and has mostly been throughout its history controlled by different kingdoms.

&#x200B;

This obsession with finding Turkic, Arabic, and now 'Afghan' roots reeks of denial and a self-loathing of our rich history as a civilization along the banks of the Indus.
