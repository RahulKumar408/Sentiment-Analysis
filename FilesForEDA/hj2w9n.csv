He had no clear ideological view. Every 5 minutes, he would change colors. Pacifist -> Aggressive nationalist -> anti-military -> secular liberal -> pro-military ->  Islamist -> religious bigot.

He was just grasping onto straws in order to convince others that IK was the worst things to happen to Pakistan. After every 3 or 4 sentences he would repeat that he was not a Zardari or Sharif supporter.

Near the end of the 'conversation', he inadvertently repeated some 2 or 3 PML-N Twitter talking points. When asked about that he became emotional about his love for Nawaz Sharif and N-league. Since he had mentioned his dad as a reference multiple times for his views and criticisms I asked him about him as well. He refused to talk further.

A google search revealed that his dad was a political appointee in the bureaucracy during PPP's tenure and laer on was investigated for flouting rules and suspected of being an accomplice to some corruption scandal.

fwkz7sf,t1_fwkfsr1,"> I have never supported any political party. So far in the history of Pakistan, this is the MOST incompetent government ever. 

Wrong, the most incompetent government is PPP, and PMLN was the government using artificial and unsustainable means to keep our economy artificially afloat through utilising forex reserves alongside loans. This was leading us to a path where we would have gone bankrupt/defaulted.

>  Such a downfall in the economy has never been faced by our country, under the reign of any other government or military leader. 

Firstly, before explaining our economic situation I'll explain how this isn't the worst economy we've ever had. [Crime under Zardari was higher](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/PAK/pakistan/crime-rate-statistics). Also [inflation skyrocketed under Zardari](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/inflation-cpi). Inflation is nowhere near as bad as you claim it is. So kindly stop parroting false information. It's currently at 8% which is drastically lesser than PPP or previous years.

> Previous governments WERE corrupt, but always had ""somewhat substantial"" progress they could flex and show to the people. This government sadly, has ""almost none"". All previous governments have held their fair share of hypocrisy. This government has descended to lowest standards in hypocrisy. It aches me to see my country in this state 

Let me quickly disprove this notion without getting too into specifics.

Firstly, what you have to realise is how under PMLN (I'm only talking about PMLN because you seriously cannot believe PPP was any better than PTI. They've done nothing for Sindh and their governance has always destroyed Pakistan back since Bhutto himself) it seems that poverty and whatnot got any better. But Nawaz Sharif was following a completely backward economic policy, which would have literally led to Pakistan going bankrupt. So I don't know why you would prefer those short-term benefits.

Nawaz Sharif took in massive loans, mortgaged off government properties and used forex reserves to artificially overvalue the rupee. During his time we saw the exports, trade deficits skyrocket. Under him we were literally living under a sweet illusion, which would have never lasted. Pakistan was on the road to bankruptcy.

When Imran Khan came into power he undid all of that, he immediately called for further taxation. Exposed the crummy practices being done. He had to undo all of the past mistakes, which is why the rupees value was revealed and we face this economic prolapse. Here’s how much the situation has improved under Imran Khan.

Asides from the increasing taxes, he has made it a policy to reduce our trade deficit which had spiked under Nawaz Sharif and again was unsustainable. Take a look at our trade deficit [and how much it's reduced under PTI/IK](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/balance-of-trade).

To further emphasize this, [take a look at Pakistan's exports under NS and then under IK](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/exports). The intense focus on increasing exports is what's resulted in the massive decrease in our trade deficit, and is vital for reviving what was becoming of our economy. [You see Pakistan actually recording profits instead of absolute deficits now as well thanks to the reduction in imports and the improved trade balance.](https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2020/06/25/current-account-records-surplus-of-13m-in-may/)

To illustrate on what Nawaz Sharif was doing, [take a look at this foreign exchange graph](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/foreign-exchange-reserves). The increase under the PMLN government is solidified proof of just how many loans he had taken, and the path of destruction we were headed on.

[We're now seeing our trade deficit contracting to $15b under Imran Khan](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2168222/2-pakistans-trade-deficit-contracts-27-15-7b#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20trade%20deficit%2C%20which,period%20of%20current%20fiscal%20year.&text=Eight%2Dmonth%20exports%20were%20equal,the%20target%20of%20%2451.7%20billion).

In short, your claims of the government having done nothing are the furthest from the truth, it has quite literally saved us from bankrupcy and imploding. If it wasn't for these drastic reforms which are already seeing massive benefits, [where even the FBR reported profits from tax despite COVID](https://arynews.tv/en/covid-19-fbr-tax-collection-target/), we would be doomed.

Please, understand that the short-term economic policy under PML-N was completely incompetent, and was leading us to a massive pit of despair, which has been turned around by PTI. If it wasn't for covid we'd have been economically way better off by 2023, but currently everything is on hold thanks to Covid, the entire world economy has contracted, so it is inevitable.",1,15,1593611048.0
