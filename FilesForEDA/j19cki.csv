The very idea of watching a bunch of grown men swatting little balls in the sun for hours is just... idiotic and seeing people cheering and rooting for their respective teams boggles my mind. 

Why? What drives them? Exactly what they find so satisfying that they gladly spend hours upon hours watching a ball get swatted around with a piece of wood?

I was watching a candid interview of Tigmanshu Dhulia, he grew up in Allahabad in a educated Hindu family.. his pronunciation was standard Urdu pronunciation, and he would easily pass off as an Urdu speaker without doubt.
