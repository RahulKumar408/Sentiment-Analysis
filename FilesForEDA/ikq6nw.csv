It's supposed to be the other way around right? If you drop testing, you will find lower amount of cases.

Also, how can you say the ratio is 1:3, while comparing tests/million and the total cases?

India has 1380 million
Pakistan has 221 million

Compare these two
1380 million for India's tests/million
221 million for Pakistan's tests/million

Since india has more millions of population, and the whole virus is based on an exponential trajectory, there is no way you can point a 1:3 ratio.

A better explanation would be for seeing cases/million and tests/million.

Pakistan- 1340 cases/million
India - 2788 cases/ million

Hence despite testing 3x more in india, the number of people infected is only 2x more, per million.

But like I said, even this is not perfect because you can't really compare such drastic differences in the population and come up with a simple ratio.",5,1,1599113331.0
