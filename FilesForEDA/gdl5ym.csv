fpjc7dg,t1_fpj89zv,FYI...you can buy ready made masala for both biryani and karahi (dry powder form). Look up Shan or National brand spices which should be available at any Pakistani store in KSA. No one i know makes their own masala anymore and we use shan masala for marinating meat and it still tastes great and makes cooking a lot easier.
