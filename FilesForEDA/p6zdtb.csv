h9i38ay,t3_p6zdtb,"He's not perfect.

But he is 100x better than PPP or PMLN. He is an honest man that truly has good intentions for his people. Think about it. He was a celebrity married to a billionaire heiress. He was a sporting legend. He could have lived the rest of his life in luxury and that would have been easier for him.

But he chose the hard route to stand up for his people instead. And he has overall done a good job so far. He managed corona well, Skirmishes in 2019, and he is making much needed reforms to our economy. 

I am calling it right now. When this man is dead, even the people who criticized him when he was alive will mourn him and will realize that this man was a once in a generation type of leader.",0,76,1629353120.0

Talk to ur provincial gov. They receive ur share of taxes. If Fed gives u something. B happy they even did 😂. Fed is actually spending a lot of money in Karachi but nashukray will remain nashukray.

All the while denying the locals any space to even fight its puppet in elections. Wo log apnay mulk main Aik invading force ke saath lar rahay thay. Lol u think that’s the same as TTP wanting to forcibly destroy and destabilize a nation 😂. 

Shabash. Goron ke neechay lagna tau koi aap se seekh. Aao bhai hum per qabza karo, hamaray logon ko maro aur ager hum resist karein tau hum buray, aur aap achay. If this is not slave mentality. I don’t know what is. 

There is no dilution. Hudaibiyah ki treaty political settlement nahi tau aur kiya thi. It’s stopped warfare and brought peace. IRA ke saath political settlement hui thi ya nahi. Political solutions are always preferred because fighting escalates. Pakistan has always offered political solution and talk to these groups and occassionally their fighters to take the amnesty offer we provide. Problem is BNP, BLA and BNM refuse to sit on the table with us. Their demand is full independence or terrorism. They are merely 2-3 tribes of dozens. Even in their tribes they don’t have full support. Like I said earlier, Jinke motivations destabilization ke hotay hain, their demands are unreasonable and unrealistic. TTP ke saath bhi multiple times political solution explore karnay ki koshesh ki, but they would pretend to hold talks and during talks they’d carry out bomb blasts and expect no reprisal. Ye tactics hotay hain to appear credible in their cause for marketing. Dekho hum kitnay strong hain, gov bhi hamaray ghutnay pakar rahi hai.
