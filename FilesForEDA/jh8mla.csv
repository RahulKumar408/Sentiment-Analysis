It is important for China to curbstomp India to the ground, They see the US as their main enemy, they would want India to be taken out of the picture as soon as possible so that they would have no secondary front to fight on.

The reason why talks on both sides are happening and failing, because some things cannot be resolved with talks and both sides are merely using talks to buy time .

But if the Chinese military gets to the point where they are 'curbstomp'-ing the Indians, then what makes you think the Indians won't use nukes? At that point they don't have much to lose. And it is because the Chinese know this that they won't put the Indians in this position.

In '65 pakistan citing India's loss with china launched offensive in Kashmir, in end result was a stalemate, pakistan lost much more than india, it failed to realise it's objective, got it's lands captured, barely managed to save lahore.

Okay. I see . You may have a point. Well done. So-
1. India did bad. But india is perfectly happy with what she has and has no remorse over it.
2. Hyderabad didn't legally join Pakistan and as far as I know didn't even ask for instrument of accession. Atleast in its inception, indian Union was concieved as a secular entity. So , india will have no issue absorbing Hyderabad. Plus , how will Hyderabad connect with Pakistan? Especially after Pakistan had a war with India a year before in 47. Hyderabad was annexed one whole year later.
3. Pakistan , as far as i know is claiming Junagadh right now. There were legal fictions used for Junagadh too.
4.  At that time Sheikh Abdullah favoured Congress. Won't it be natural for a Kashmiri to favor a Kashmiri? If your dear founder was a statesman , he would have been cautious and got Kashmir without doing anything.
5. I have never heard of Pakistan claiming lakshadweep. It may be the most islamic territory in the union. Why so?

7. I feel sorry for you guys. I didnt want to be born here but i am glad i wasnt in that place. That place reminds me of everything about the old india.

There is a reason, indian liberals have a patronising view of pakistan. Shastri wasnt anti pakistan . Indira was . But for you it was all the same. Because it was ultimately a buffer state to protect us from the russians. Today you guard us from the taliban.

And lol @ secularism, you guy still pretending to be secular? I thought Modi-Ji put an end to that. 

3. Nope, we claimed Junagadh from the very beginning since it was legally given to us. Unfortunately we had no military at the time and Kashmir also became a thing so we had to prioritize other issues. 
Now that we know we can serve fantastic tea to Indians, we are reminding the world of our legal claim. 

4.  Sheikh Abdullah was a fool, just like Mulana Azad, they have all been proven wrong by the suffering and rape of their people in India. 
Besides, non of that matters. If India can take Junagadh due to Hindu population, then Pakistan can take Kashmir due to Muslim population. 

5. They never acceded to us and their population has never shown interest to join us. We are not Indians, we don't need to prove we don't have small pee pees. Kashmir people do not want to be with India, they want to join Pakistan or be independent.

6. Bangladeshis are not Hindus yet India supported them in 71. The extent Pakistan supported Sikhs was not even 1% of the amount India supported the Bangladeshis in 71. SO once again, India is the source of the problem.

3. lol, facts are now mental gymnastics. Indian education at work everyone. 
4. Just following India's lead as they were the ones who set the precedent that the decision of the ruler is an unbreakable law.... unless India doesn't like it, then it means nothing and it is okay to invade. Heck, India even set the precedent that is okay to invade and take over your neighbor as they did to Goa in the 60s. 
5. That is something you just made up. Afghanistan also has a Muslim majority and at one point in the 60s there was a real proposal by them to join Pakistan, we rejected it. You didn't know that and you thought making this point was going to really trump me. lol
6. So when India does bad things ""realpolitik"" but when Pakistan does it ""OMG, EVIL PAKISTAN""   
Indian and Hypocrisy are really synonymous. 
7. and what did you do with your literacy? Just opened up scam centers to steal money from old white women. Talking about vassal, you guys are literally begging big daddy US to become a vassal to defend against China.   
Also, thanks for acknowledging all the facts I made in that how much better Pakistan is in the issues I listed.  
8. I expect international law to be followed. Disputed territory is open game for violence, we have violence there to this day in border shelling. Launching an attack on a sovereign border is against international law, which is India did. You really have to learn to de-program yourself from the indoctrination you have received. 
9. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemptive\_war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preemptive_war#Legality)  
"" In order to be justified as an act of self-defense, two conditions must be fulfilled which are widely regarded as necessary for its justification. The first of these is that actor must have believed that the threat is real, as opposed to (merely) perceived. The second condition is that the force used in self-defense must be proportional to the harm which the actor is threatened.  ""  
Pakistan met both those conditions as India was actively attacking us in East Pakistan and the force used was only on military targets. 
10.  don't see any link.

Again, you really should get your depression checked out, so many Indians commit suicide for being born Indian. I would hate for you to fall to that.   
Right now what is happening is that for the first time in your life someone has shown a mirror to your brainwashing and indoctrination and you are going through an existential crisis. 

Your brainwashing tells you that this is India

As for the textbooks, yep, Pakistan had a problem. It is now being addressed and new textbooks have been issued and problem is being addressed .  


What did India do to address it's rape and murder of minorities problem?  
Oh right, they elected the rapist and murderers into office.

The delusion you are are under is that India and Pakistan are the same.   
We are not the same.   
Just compare the happiness index for example

Indians are clearly depressed for being born Indian while Pakistanis are not.
