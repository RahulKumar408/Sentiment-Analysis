>Why is that always the answer?

Not an answer at all, it's rather a curse.

>I don't understand why we use that as an excuse.

Looks like you're very powerful, why don't you go fix it. And since you are wise why don't you guide everyone. We can't do everything we want in this world, I'm disappointed with the government and I don't think these guys want to change a lot

Come on, yaar.  Of course, that is just as bad. We don't have a effective court system.

Yup,

>We are a society make decisions.

Yes, but can u implement it? No, you have no position in the government. Unfortunately, if you look at the history of pakistan, all you see is a power struggle among the elite who are financially perfect yet they misuse the government powers and still wrongly keep the people in poverty And confusion and use it as a tool, I'm tired of seeing this repeat itself again.

>I feel your answer makes it clear that our society does not want to fix things.

You feel wrong, I want to fix it but I don't think it's really possible now, I've given up a lot of hope. I am tied now of even speaking up now cuz it's off no use. You're being optimistic, I'm being realistic.
