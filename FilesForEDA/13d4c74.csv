If he can stand up to these crooks at 70 years old, what will you stand up for? Keep in mind what’s staring right at Pakistan is more poverty, joblessness and with these ppl in power no hope for middle class to get a fair chance at life to move up and no chance they will change anything.

otherwise bow down to these ppl forever when no one in the highest power circles will speak for justice for everyone and hope for a nation. Do not accept this and give these ppl any hope that ppl will be ok with this fascism. Without the ppl demanding accountability there’s no hope for the future generations just as the last 30 years have been lost to hopelessness, there could be nothing worse than children growing up in a place where there’s no law and justice in society",0,111,1683676883.0

They (at least the older ones) live in a bubble and will bitch and moan about America (in an arrogant way in which they’re better than the rest of us Americans) but when asked to move back to Pakistan if they hate it there so much they find every excuse in the book that doesn’t involve telling the truth (“oh but my business/work/family/whatever other bullshit excuse”).  I’ll be honest, when I first accepted Islam and spent time in the masajid the worst people to hang around were the OSPs (I’m not talking about the students or Pakistanis in the US temporarily).  They’d invite you to their house just to show off how wealthy they were (this was so cringe, and peak stupid, for all they knew I could’ve been casing the place for burglary and they gave me everything except the combination to their safe), maybe give me a cup of tea and I’d realize I wasted an entire afternoon at their house just looking at their Armani suits and other bullshit.  The entire time they’d be insulting my own country and my own people.  

The ones who were born and raised in the US (only country I’m really familiar with OSPs, despite having lived in the UK prior to being Muslim), are highly assimilated and don’t behave like this, but their immigrant parents are like this bad and wealthier people here are like this.  I just couldn’t get over the complete lack of self awareness they had insulting everyone in my own country while benefitting from the opportunity there and then doing it to my face.  And then God help you if you wanted to marry their daughter, no, their daughter’s only purpose was getting the rest of the family out of Pakistan through forced marriage (unless you were filthy rich and the same caste or whatever unislamic bullshit excuse they had).  There were some exceptions to this but by and large this was my experience (had a very good friend who left Pakistan in the 70’s and was a huge PPP bigwig but now criticizes everything that you all criticize and I would criticize, and never ever gives an air of superiority, may Allah take care of him ameen).  And they will try to force feed you whatever madhab they follow and you’re basically a kafir if you don’t do exactly as they do (I see this here too with the masjid uncles, I loved the Arabs in the states because they wouldn’t force their views down your throat and actually had proper Islamic sources for whatever they told you and not some superstitious old wives tale).",1,1,1683966520.0

Being Istanbul's mayor is already quiet a political position as it's a cosmopolitan city filled with people from not only all over the country, but internationally.

He was removed for a controversial line in a poem mosques are our barracks, minarets our lances, domes our helmets. That's when he set up the AKP. Which won elections, some say to his jail term for the poem, bit the country was kind of stale and he had charisma. Turkey was heavily conservative, as most rural countries are.

But as Prime Minister he continued and expanded the country's Economic plans and truly brought economic prosperity. International he was seen as a reformer, lenient on the forced secularity of the country but some thoughts ran against progressivism. 

Using courts for favorable results, controversial constitutional referendums that granted him powers (presidential, party chairmanship, judicial), censorship, corruption, to name a few major ones.

The 2 level game is; Internationally he took up Neo-Ottomanism. He felt since Turkey was the successor to the Ottoman it had a place covering N. Africa and the Middle East. And domestically routinely went against Ataturk's vision of secularism.
