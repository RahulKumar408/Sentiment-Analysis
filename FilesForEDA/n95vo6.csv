>what can we do when arabs themselves don't care about their bros in occupied palestine.

What does that have to do with anything? 

The Pakistani people are sympathetic to the suffering of the ummah in general.

This goes back to even before partition:

If you examine how we helped Turkey at a time when Pakistan didn't even exist; when our own empire had been conquered and our homeland was under British control, we understood what would happen to the Turks if the Western powers beat them as it had happened to us as well and we helped them avoid that same fate.

Then the scars of partition showed their effect on our mentality.

I believe that it is our experience from the partition with [East Punjab being ethnically cleansed of Muslims in Muslim-majority areas by better armed, better-organized,](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/did-sikhs-squads-participate-organised-attempt-cleanse-east-punjab-during-partition)[ and better-equipped non-Muslims](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/did-sikhs-squads-participate-organised-attempt-cleanse-east-punjab-during-partition) that drives us when such situations arise elsewhere. 

Our [actions in Bosnia](https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/hprk61/a_brief_thread_explaining_bosnian_genocide_and/fxto5gn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) where the Muslim Bosnians were being ethnically cleansed being a prime example. 

So why is it that Pakistan has gone from: 

* Diplomatically helping Muslim nations like Algeria and Indonesia to break out from Western colonialism in the 50s.
* Assigning men and material to wars fought against usurpers of Muslim territories in the 60s and 70s in Palistine.
* Backing proxies in Afghanistan that accelerated the Soviet Union's dissolving in the 80s
* Assisting Bosnians all the way in the Balkans in Europe during the 90s.

To basically just sitting tight to the point that even I sometimes say that ""Mard-e-Mujahid so rahey hai"". The answer seems pretty simple but is beyond complicated.

We hit our peak in the 90s a time in which we did not have to focus on any threats to our sovereign territory from the Western borders and could focus entirely on India.

Revealing ourselves as a nuclear power put the spotlight on us permanently and was immediately followed with sanctions. This was then soon followed by 9/11 which overnight warped the perception of Muslims across the world.

Not to mention that as soon as the US settled in Afghanistan they set up a puppet government that went back to claiming our territory and backing groups like the TTP with help from India.

In the ensuing proxy war, we lost an estimated 83 thousand people and over 120 billion USD and pretty much stagnated for the past 20 years. We'd been reduced to putting out fires at home.

But the geopolitical situation is changing and hopefully, we go back to playing an active role in the betterment of the ummah like we used to, it was one of the few good things our country has done in the world.",1,13,1620705651.0

In the first example it says passport in the parenthesis to clear confusion, there is a reason why the word will have fell out of use, and also at that time it will have been shortened from ""kaaghaz e rahdari"", which means ""Travel Document"". ""Kaaghaz e rahdari"" could literally be the formal version of saying ""rahdari"".

The fact is ""rahdari"" alone can mean Passport which is why it's in the dictionary with references, and it's why it also says:

رک: راہداری کا پروانہ

Meaning: ""Look for: Rahdari Ka parwana"", it was shortened to Rahdari, which means passport (but not necessarily just passport).

Like I said the word راہداری wasn't invented for the word ""passport"", definitions do and can changes over time. In fact, a lot of Arabic and Persian loans are like this. راہداری will have originally meant ""passage"" or ""corridor"" (like Kartarpur Rahdari"") but the definition will have changed so that the English ""Passport"" was also included in the meaning.",8,2,1620671465.0

You can translate a lot of words to mean ''passport''.. Persian word گذرنامه could be used to refer to passport which would be valid in Urdu as well as it's a literal translation in Urdu would be ''certificate for passing''. However why are we complicating Urdu language here? The word is direct borrowing from English and this was always the official usage. It didn't ''fell out of usage''. No passports were required to enter or exit India before British rule, so just like the word 'computer', we did not have to appropriate another word to explain what it means.

I'm not even trying to. I'm just saying that Rahdari should have been the word for ""passport"", that's all I'm saying. Even in the Napalese language, the word for Passport is Rahda**n**i and it is written on the actual document. Rahdari just didn't pick up in Urdu hence why passport is still used in official documents but my point is, Urdu is a separate language and isn't meant to be a pidgin of languages.

Just like 'nikah nama' means 'marriage certificate'. 

On the other hand, English words like certificate (سرٹیفیکیٹ) or record (ریکارڈ) are part of formal Urdu vocabulary. For example birth certificate is commonly referred to as paidaishi certificate or sometimes برتھ سرٹیفکیٹ. Urdu does not become a pidgin language just because it adopted English words..  where do you think all the Perso Arabic words in Urdu come from? Read history, they were introduced, sometimes as a deliberate act and sometimes just organically like languages evolved. Just like English does not become a pidgin language adopting Urdu words like 'jungle' ' loot' 'bungalow' 'pajama' 'shampoo' etc etc.

>Except the reference is from 1951, used alone as Rahdari. Not back in the 1800s.

That is invalid reference, since it literally is trying to explain away what 'rahdari' means in that context by adding passport in parenthesis. 

Point is, we already have an Urdu word for passport, it's 'passport'. Just like we Urdu word for rail is rail and computer is computer. You can't claim some other word is the correct word for these (even if you can find a Perso-Arabic equivalent and appropriate that change that word's initial meaning)..

> English words like certificate and record are part of formal Urdu vocabulary 

I don't object to that. I'm not saying that we shouldn't English vocabulary in Urdu, neither am I saying that loanwords shouldn't be used. I'm saying that we shouldn't use English vocabulary **in place of Urdu words**. Words that are actually part of Urdu. And yes, if you just consistently throw in Arabic, Persian, English words and not further your language, then in the end it does pretty much become a pidgin.

> That is invalid references

I did explain that.

> Point is, we already have an Urdu word for passport, it's 'passport'. Just like the Urdu word for rail is rail and computer is computer. 

That's because there is no suitable alternative to 'rail' or 'computer' and it's just easier to use loanwords than to make calques. But when words actually get formed, they shouldn't get stomped for loanwords, and I'm not just talking about 'راہداری' here but a lot of Urdu words.

> You can't claim some other word is the correct word  

I'm not saying that 'passport' isn't part of Urdu vocabulary! I'm just saying that at least on official documents it shouldn't be 'passport' when you have a good equivalent. And when it comes to usage, you could skim through Urdu documents or Urdu government websites and see that they've used 'technical' words when it would just be easier to use English loanwords, I'll try and find examples, but the fact is usage clearly doesn't even matter.

It's a simple of case whoever was in charge of designing the passport, probably just didn't know the Urdu for 'passport' and thought the appropriate word would be just 'passport', and the design has just been kept.",3,1,1620686189.0
