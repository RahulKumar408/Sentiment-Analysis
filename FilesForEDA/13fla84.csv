The same is the situation in many many countries like Egypt, Ethiopia, latin america and no body bats an eye because it suits the international powers to control the army of a country which has power instead of polititions which can change and have variable power. 

I wish IK the best of luck and I pray for him that he succeeds.

Now that the US said “ah screw it” to the whole adventure in Afghanistan and with Russia being Russia, Pakistan is just not really front-and-center in people’s minds - but that’s not personal. People can only pay attention to so many things. 

I’ve been watching videos of police brutality on the streets of Pakistan - never good - and it seems like people here - who are more likely to lean educated, liberal, young, etc - are firmly in the Imran Khan camp, so that alone makes me think he’s the “good guy” in all this.",1,4,1683931373.0

Pakistan as a country shouldn't exist. There is no historical or cultural reason for its existence.
Durand should be given back to Afghanistan, Balochistan should be an independent country.
