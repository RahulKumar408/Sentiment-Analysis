This is about a recent rape case in which a woman and her 4 year-old daughter were sexually assaulted and raped for days. The rapists held the woman’s daughter and told her to bring another child to replace her. This is where Muhammad Bux sent his OWN daughter to safely rescue the 4 year old and catch one of the rapists. What an absolute legend. Deserves all the praise and medals this country can bestow.

Edit: Govt of Sindh has announced to cover his daughter’s education expense and also recommended her for a civilian award for her bravery. Bux Sahab will also be given a gallantry award by GoS. GoS has also recommended the federal govt. that Bux Sahab be awarded the highest police award.",0,194,1605263010.0
