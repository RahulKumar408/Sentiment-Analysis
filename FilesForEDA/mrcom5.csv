gulfmtq,t3_mrcom5,"I lived in Karachi for a year in Gulshan-e-hadeed. There were half a dozen easy load walay near my place. Literally, every single guy there used to sell a 200 Rs charger for 600-800 except one guy whose name was Sooraj and he was a Hindu.  
Another guy told me that the ""CURVED"" screen protector of my s7 edge would cost 700, Sooraj sold me the same screen protector for 150 Rs.  
So if anyone from gulshan-e-Hadeed needs a new charger or mobile protector go to Sooraj's shop near Peer bazaar in phase 2.",0,167,1618487842.0

gun94sr,t3_mrcom5,"Sikhs are just another breed. These people are so full of joy and love it's hard to express in words. Even in indian punjab it's common for multiple sikh businessmen or neighbors visiting mosques prior to Ramadan seeking permission to arrange for iftar throughout the month. I request Punjabi Muslims from other side of the border to treat them and their religion with the respect they deserve because that's just how they behave with others where they're a majority too.

gulsuy8,t3_mrcom5,"Islamic social justice includes three things, namely: (1) fair and equitable distribution of wealth, (2) provision of basic necessities of life to the poor, and the needy, and (3) protection of the weak against economic exploitation by the strong.

I would say this man is following Islamic principles more closely than most Muslims themselves despite practicing Sikhi but those who use Islam as a mere tool in Pakistan, rather than a moral compass, can easily self anoint themselves as morally superior to him just by the virtue of their Muslim identity. 

This guy is a true ambassador of his faith and is seeking salvation through a selfless act of service, he will attract others to seek more knowledge about his belief system through positive association, not coercion, much like Islam proscribes.

I would encourage others to read the Guru Granth Sahib as it includes passages by Baba Farid. There are also passages by Guru Nanak Dev that express great love and devotion for the Prophet Muhammad (SAAW). In fact a lot of Shabads are in Farsi which I feel most Sikhs are losing the ability to decipher due to be being culturally disconnected from Afghanistan and Iran. Much like these countries have lost their pluralistic traditions over the years due to developing a siege mentality because of threats of violence and intervention, same has happened in Pakistan but perhaps still to a lesser degree. 

Hence why the onus is on us to change the tide of history and transform ourselves from a security state to one of economic and ideological confluence.",0,13,1618495238.0
