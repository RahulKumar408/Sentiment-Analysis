Here is a collection of Quaid e azm quotes does this man sound like a secular ? No he is a rational intelligent tolerant Muslim. People change and grow into the person that they are meant to be.

* The Quran is the general code for the Muslims, a religious, social, civil, commercial, military, judicial, criminal and penal code. It regulates every thing, from the ceremonies of religion to those of daily life, from the salvation of the soul to the health of the body, from the rights of all to those of each individual from morality to crime; from punishment here to that in the life to come, and our Holy Prophet Mohammad (Peace by upon Him) has enjoined on us that every Musalman should posses a copy of the Quran and be his own priest. Therefore, Islam is not merely confined to the spiritual tenets and doctrines or ritual and ceremonies. It is a complete code regulating the whole Muslim society, every department of life, collective and individual. Eid-ul-Fitar message (September 1945)
* The **constitution of Pakistan** has yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly. I do not know what the ultimate shape of this constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be of a **democratic type, embodying the essential principle of Islam.** Today, they are as applicable in actual life as they were 1,300 years ago. **Islam and its idealism have taught us democracy.** It has taught equality of man, justice and fairplay to everybody. We are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan. In any case **Pakistan is not going to be a theocratic State to be ruled by priests with a divine mission. We have many non-Muslims — Hindus, Christians, and Parsis — but they are all Pakistanis. They will enjoy the same rights and privileges as any other citizens** **and will play their rightful part in the affairs of Pakistan.** Broadcast to the people of the United States of America on Pakistan (February 1948)

The same world view ushered in the era where children who weren't killed in the womb are so broken that they can't even tell what gender they belong to. Everything that ensures a society is able to function is questioned and obligations every society imposed on its people are lifted in favor of right rights rights.

Typical westernized house slave. Secularism is a discriminatory principle which allows for even Hitler's national socialism to be the state ideology but not any religious ideology. You allow discrimination when it suits you. filth!. Islam offers something far superior than imposing someone elses ideology on a people who don't believe init. Christians, hindus, buddhists, muslims have their own civil code. Why would we want some other ideology imposed on us, when we can simply be ruled by our own ideologies. 

The difference between an athiest and a muslim is this. A muslim wants his gov to impose Islamic laws on himself because those are the laws he lives by.

I'm still confused about this incest point. Atheism isn't an ideology so it doesn't have prescriptions, it is just the disbelief in a god, you don't even understand that, jeez, you're embarrassing. Your book allows you to marry your cousins and have deformed babies. You advocate for incest, not I. You're projecting with the bestiality stuff. I shouldn't have to address all this, you are just spraygunning weird assertions to try and make a point. Who says atheists take their morality from the state? You are just talking rubbish.

If you think Nazism would be allowed under secular humanism, then you're dumber than I thought. Humanism aims to maximise human wellbeing, Nazism is antithetical to that. Yes, religions have their own civil code. Do you know how the best way to allow every person to follow their own religious code? By having a secular state. In an Islamic state, non-Muslims are subjected to Islamic laws. In a secular state, the state has no relation to religion, so you're free to practice your religion (of course, until it affects others negatively- which is in inevitability with extremists like yourself). Islam doesn't offer anything better, other than being an archaic, flawed ideology. 

Now you've gone from secularism to atheism again. You're all over the place. A Muslim wants government to impose a way of life, very authoritarian. Yet, the secularist wants a government which protests the rights of all citizens. Hmm, I wonder what is better.

gxzhn2l,t1_gxzdqp1,"on the basis of 2 nation theory:

In Muhammad Ali Jinnah's All India Muslim League presidential address delivered in Lahore, on March 22, 1940, he explained:

It is extremely difficult to appreciate why our Hindu friends fail to understand **the real nature of Islam and Hinduism. They are not religions in the strict sense of the word, but are, in fact, different and distinct social orders, and it is a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality**, and this misconception of one Indian nation has troubles and will lead India to destruction if we fail to revise our notions in time. The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs, litterateurs. They neither intermarry nor interdine together and, indeed, they belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions. Their aspect on life and of life are different. It is quite clear that Hindus and Mussalmans derive their inspiration from different sources of history. They have different epics, different heroes, and different episodes. Very often the hero of one is a foe of the other and, likewise, their victories and defeats overlap. To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built for the government of such a state.

In 1944, Jinnah said:

**We maintain and hold that Muslims and Hindus are two major nations by any definition or test of a nation. We are a nation of hundred million and what is more, we are a nation with our own distinctive culture and civilization, language and literature, art and architecture, names and nomenclature, sense of values and proportions, legal laws and moral codes, customs and calendar, history and tradition, and aptitude and ambitions. In short, we have our own outlook on life and of life.**

Allahabad address by Allama Iqbal

Commenting on the Hindu fears of religious rule in the Muslim autonomous states, Iqbal said:

Muslim demand is not actuated by the kind of motive he imputes to us; it is actuated by a genuine desire for free development which is practically impossible under the type of unitary government contemplated by the nationalist Hindu politicians with a view to secure permanent command dominance in the whole of India. Nor should the Hindus fear that the creation of autonomous Muslim states will mean the introduction of a kind of religious rule in such states.

gxzf8vc,t1_gxzdqp1,"Jizya is not a mandatory practice in the sense we need a religious tax. This tax can be collected in many different forms. This was the only form of tax that people had to pay under an Islamic empire. They did not pay any other tax. It was only paid by men not women or children nor the elderly. They had to pay less tax then the Muslims who had to pay double the normal and the zakat tax. Under nation states people have to multiple forms of tax and there is no need for it. The sole purpose was to ensure minorities rights were protected by the state. Since Pakistan state can do an all citizens can pay tax and gst in many forms it is not required anymore as economic models have changed.

2 nation theory literally negates your arguments and it is literally is the voice of millions who made a a conscious decision by the Pakistani movement to adopt independance and model it after Islamic values it says so in our manifesto which millions have died to make this into a reality. You are literally whitewashing the role of Muslim league and 2 nation theories and the vision of Allama Iqbal over a quote.

I got your number pappu, which is why you don't like me exposing the degeneracy that is normalized when atheist grow in a society. You still trying to use the old trope, 'atheism is simply disbelief in a God'. No shit, of course that is what what atheism is. What happens to an athiest when they no longer identify with a moral framework? They still need morals to function through life, don't they.? So what do these morons do, where do they go fetch a new morality from? They blindly end up following the dominant global culture's morality. Secular liberal humanism. Your atheist profits tend to agree with each other's morals. Majority of western and westernized house slave atheists follow the same moral framework. Its amazing that I have to spoon feed you these things. lol. Not much free thinking going on in that head when you act like good dog and follow along the goray. 

Now, since you think you can try to hide the filth that is produced by atheists, howz about you kindly show me where world famous atheist speakers like Sam Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, Krouse actually denounce bestiality. Not sure that u can, because the clips below show their endorsement of it.

You also don't need to be confused about the incest point because your very own atheist profits whose idealogy you follow also accept incest with out children as an acceptable practice. Another nasty behavior atheists seek to normalize. 

Its the wealth of literature about morality with out God is what shows that the athiest if they were honest would have to off themselves because living the reality of atheist existence would have to lead the atheist to accept that there is no value in life. Killing a baby is no different than smashing a rock, just rearrangement of matter and energy. Yet this here is another reason why bestiality tourism is now a thing in european countries with the highest rates of atheism. Freaks!!!

Can't use cliche's on me babydoll. The point remains secularism is a discriminatory principle  which allows for even Hitler's national socialism to be the state ideology but not any religious one. Do uncomfortable argument often cause you to flail and divert the discussion because thats what seems to be happening here. 

Islamic humanism aims to maximize human happiness, not the atheist humanism. Atheist humanism seeks to break down social order and society. Tell me again which societies can no longer breed worth shit. Which societies have kids who can't even figure out what their gender is. Its not religious or communitarian societies, I can tell you that much. Its the societies where atheism is growing. 

You're little brain still hasn't figured what I was trying to educate you on, society functions when society IMPOSES obligations on its members. Individualistic societies that breed atheism don't do that. They are only concerned with their rights and no one dares speak about the obligations of a people to the society. Obligations which ensure essential social functions continue to be carried out by its members in order to keep a society healthy. So how do these backward individualistic societies function? ding ding ding, a big strong state with its over arching institutions keep the society organized with the use of violence. Since you gave up the morals that create stable societies, your state now tells you what your morality will be. Bestiality ? check. Incest? check. Tranny kids? check. women's exploitation? check.

You can claim it isn't mandatory, but then you're saying the Quran prescribed unnecessary things- I'm unsure if you want to go down that road. Saying it's not required anymore surely constituted bid'ah. 

Regarding the reason for jizya, the Quran itself says its to subjugate the dhimmi (my not be verbatim), and Ibn Kathir's tasfir says it's to disgrace and humble the dhimmi. So to suggest it's entirely about protecting their rights is wrong. 

\>Jinnah and Secularism 

I literally posted what he said in his speech. I am not talking about what happened and what others thought, I said that Jinnah wanted secularism, and he did. He described secularism without saying it. But you want to blindly believe that he didn't. I fully accept that many others wanted an Islamic nation, but my whole point was talking about Jinnah.

\>You people take an extreme meaning of completely abandoning your culture and religion and adopting a Westen one while dehumanising those who take pride in them.

Secularism isn't inherently Western. It just happens to be adopted in the West more. Appealing to tradition is a fallacy- just because it's traditional, it doesn't make it right. When have I dehumanised anyone? You're throwing a tantrum at a monster you created in your head. But *you* are attacking an ideology which would treat everyone equally, in favour of one that heavily favours Muslims. Also, you mention 'abandoning culture and religion', you conveniently ignored the end of my last post which mentioned the Islam was the religion of the coloniser. Is that really your religion? See, I can easily go down this route if you use the 'tradition' argument.

Oh yes, Muslims who are famous for their intellect. Believing in Muhammad going to heaven on a winged donkey with the face of a man, believing humans are made of clay, that Muhammad was made of light, believing sperm originates from between the backbone and the ribs, that there's a barrier between salt and fresh water, you got me there pal. You don't understand atheism if you think it entails any type of morals. There are so many different ideas of non-theistic morality, such as egoism, Sidgwick's knowable fundamental axioms, Kant's categorical and hypothetical imperatives, etc. There are issues with the divine command theory that you subscribe to, the most famous example being the Euthyphro dilemma. But you just happened to be born into the correct system, right? It totally has nothing to do with your ancestors getting conquered and you continually simping for the religion of the oppressor. You simply assert that atheists tend towards the same belief. You are just an idiot that keeps asserting things. Secular morality is so varied, it can be derived from the theories I mentioned before, or any other ones. There are examples of secular morality all throughout Asia's history, long before the goray. I know you're still colonised in your mind, though (happily colonised by the Muslims, but you feel insecure about the goray). 

\>Dawkins

First of all, he says he opposes those things. The argument is a philosophical one, but an uncomfortable one, sure. However, let me be charitable to you, even though you would never be to me. Let's say Dawkins said it's okay to have sex with children. Guess what? It doesn't reflect on atheism at all. Just because he's a well-known atheist, it doesn't mean it has anything to do with atheists. Again, atheism is just the lack of belief in god, it is not a belief system, just as 'not playing golf' is not a sport. But let's go down the paedophilia route, then. How old was Aisha? How old was Muhammad? What about when he 'thighed' her before he consummated the marriage (leading to multiple fatwas on the permissibility of thighing)? You really shouldn't be mentioning all this nonsense without realising your prophet is the biggest perpetrator. 

Again, there are no atheist prophets. You are the ones who emulate everything Muhammad does, down to growing a beard, how he sits, having multiple wives (though you can't have as much as him...how convenient for him), removal of body hair, how you go to the toilet, etc. You also have to defend every reprehensible thing he did, such as fondling his child bride, all the offensive wars. him attacking his own people in the caravan raids, saying the murder of a woman who slandered him was permissible, having slaves and being a slave trader, slaughtering a tribe and sleeping with the most beautiful woman of the tribe right after, etc. Continue simping. If Dawkins, Denett, Harris, Hitchens, Singer, Law, and any other prominent atheist/atheist philosopher says something objectionable, I'd object. You, however, *have* to accept any reprehensible thing your prophets do, because your religion requires you to simp. 

Islamic humanism? LOL. Humanism puts people at the centre of morality, regardless of what they believe. Islam *cannot* do that. Islam murders gays, apostates, 'fornicators' (or lashes them), subjugates women, censors speech- the shariah is a police state. There is no way Islam can be reconciled with humanism unless you reform Islam (yes please!). Laughable. And you keep parroting right-wing, Fox News talking points. The overwhelming majority of people (and children) in the West accept the traditional gender binaries. You're once again fighting against a monster you made in your mind. You should really see a shrink, these delusions are getting worse. 

\>You're little brain still hasn't figured what I was trying to educate you on

Lol, the irony is palpable. You're so braindead. You're arguing for authoritarianism with the imposition of obligation. You decry secularism, yet the secular states do better than religious ones. No one gets murdered for speech, women don't get subjugated (at least not to the degree as they do in Islamic nations) , Islamic countries are a cesspit. Because education in secular countries is so much better, the state doesn't need to impose values on them. You're unironically simping for authoritarianism LOL. Again. Incest? Yes, Islam allows for cousins to marry and procreate, whereas incest is illegal in illegal in the vast majority of secular nations. Bestiality? Illegal in secular nations, just another strawman. Women exploitation? You're going crazy now. Women in secular countries have 1000000% more rights than in Islam. In Islam they are relegated to being house slaves and wearing bags. Get out of here with that rubbish. 'Tranny kids'? Once again, Fox News talking points, no need to even address that. You're drowning, kid. Your ideology is from ignorant men in the desert and you're laughing at an ideology which aims to treat everyone equal under the law. Stop wasting my time.",2,1,1620989695.0

gxzk0nq,t1_gxzik21,"tax itself is paid to state in many different ways such as GST since economic models have changed it is the same result. What part do you not understand this was the only form of tax that men only paid. There was no other tax. Therefore since there are more taxes which all citizens pay including minorities which the state has vowed to protect their rights. It is basically the same thing. Minorities and Muslims have have to pay tax broken down into smaller components the result is the same thus this is how nation states have adapted. Simple.

Also plenty of research has been done to debunk the subjugation of the minorities. More cope from the facists.

jizya paid by Jews under Islamic rule provided a ""surer guarantee of protection from non-Jewish hostility"" than that possessed by Jews in the Latin West. The Pact of Umar, which stipulated that Muslims must ""do battle to guard"" the dhimmis and ""put no burden on them greater than they can bear"",. Yaser Ellethy states that the ""insignificant amount"" of the jizya, as well as its progressive structure and exemptions leave no doubt that it was not imposed to persecute people or force them to convert. Julius Wellhausen held that the poll tax amounted to so little that exemption from it did not constitute sufficient economic motive for conversion. Similarly, Thomas Arnold states that jizya was ""too moderate"" to constitute a burden, ""seeing that it released them from the compulsory military service that was incumbent on their Muslim fellow subjects."" He further adds that converts escaping taxation would have to pay the legal alms, zakat, that is annually levied on most kinds of movable and immovable property.

He did not say that he wanted no religion in the eyes of the state only that state does not discriminate nor the people among themselves. Where religious divide does not exist. It does not say to abandon our religious principles in favour of secularism. That was your inane conclusion. More coping from you no doubt.

Tradiation, culture and religion mattered it was the case for our 2 nation theory defence. Get over it. Your convientatly are not understanding that when we made Pakistan the Muslims of India consciously adopted Islam into their lives it marked the end of colonialism being the reason for Islam. Islam was chosen by the indigenous inhabitants when Pakistan was made. Yeah cope even further. I suggest you read Quaid e azm and Allama Iqbal view on Marxism it’s not popular.",3,3,1620919441.0

The burden is on Muslims to follow the sunnah and and to follow his peaceful teachings which led a tolerant, diverse, equal empire where there was no poverty, no homelessness, no discrimination nor injustice.

Ibn Kathr interpretation which is what a tafseer is in which scholar gives his own personal comments not a hadith. It would appear he is more popular in the salafi school of thought thus not a mainstream scholar. Though as extinguished his works maybe. Many scholars that are sunnis and Sufi would disagree and find a way to adapt the principles. This was done by many scholars like ahmed bin hanbal  and others. I would disagree because many Islamic empires and even scholars had discussed the methods of business dealings, transactions by working with problem and seeing what’s popular with the masses if there was no appropriate solution in the texts such is the case of a modern nation state taxation model. Many Islamic empires abolished  jizya in many periods of their rule and all Islamic nations states decided that since all citizens will be paying various forms of tax and all the citizens rights will be protected the essential idea and principle  essentially remains the same of a) minorites paying tax b) Muslims paying zakat and tax c) nation states following examples like the pact of umar, treaties and constitution ensuring that all their rights are protected. The tax model we have today is valid.

if one scholar has a hardliners opinion that does not mean the rest of the scholars and certainly government officials or the masses will share that opinions. Scholars provide an opinion or a comment they cannot make decision on behalf of the state and certainly cannot be political. However they offer an opinion on said problem.

gxzr34c,t1_gxzn2ye,"I don't think you understand. Having an Islamic system will *always* favour Muslims. Having a secular system will be more equal for people of all faiths and non-faith. You just want to have a system based on what you were raised to believe, not because you think it's more equal. 

And now you're just handwaving Ibn Kathir. There are others who corroborate him, such as this paper saying the Fuqaha considers jizya as a badge of humiliation for not being Muslim. Just because minorities pay tax, it doesn't mean it's the same as the jizya, this is bid'ah (and I'm all for it). The Quran itself even mentions those who pay the jizya being subdued:   
*Fight those People of the Book who do not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day, and do not take as unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have declared as unlawful, and do not profess the Faith of Truth; (fight them) until they pay jizyah with their own hands while they are subdued.*

I'm sorry, but you are trying to rationalise this post-hoc. 

It is also interesting that you consider Ibn Kathir just one 'hardline scholar'. 

[https://quranx.com/tafsirs/9.29](https://quranx.com/tafsirs/9.29)

In the same way many secular countries like France will implement their own cultural values at the detriment of others. Secularism under Marxism had dire repercussions. Certainly under secular regimes like Mao and Stalin.  A secular framework in practice even if your remove all gender, racial and other forms of discrimination will still not function if the society at large will elect Extremists into the parliament like India. Even the general nature of culture, gender roles and various ideologies. There is nothing in Jinnah speeches that showed his defence of secularism simply the promotion of equality among all of humanity and tolerance that can coexist in Islam.The nature of tafs is providing and opinion by the said scholar it is not a hadith.

I’ll have to do more reading on the context behind the quote and history of it. But what is clear Muslims cannot unlawfully claim the wealth of minorities . if memory serves me correctly this was due to the aftermath of Jewish tribes breaking the treaties and agreement they had over a certain issue which led to widespread poverty and deaths for Muslims.

Muslims, like any other religious groups, did religious conquests. Once they run the area, they ask for jizya because it is required by the Quran.
