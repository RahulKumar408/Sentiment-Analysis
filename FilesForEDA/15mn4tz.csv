jvkvcud,t3_15mn4tz,"Pakistani people have finally realised who the bad actors really are in the system. It’s not the politicians who have been messing around, it’s the beghairat oppressive fauj which never let any honest and sincere politician run the country in peace. Because they knew justice, impartiality and fair play (ironically quote by the founder of the country) would mean no role of “Fauj” in the state affairs. I am afraid people are only bad mouthing fauj because they have an honest person like Imran Khan at the opposite corner. What if it’s Nawaz Sharif or Zardari or their likes again in a few years? Would people still hate fauj as much? Would everything go back to “normal” and politicians would become the villains again?
