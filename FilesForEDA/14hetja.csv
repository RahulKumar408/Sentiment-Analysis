While this seems to be happening all over the world (lack of adequate parenting), I want to focus on this sentence for a moment, barring geography.

I think parents of today basically have a child because whatever, but they don't have the aptitude to raise a child. They may make money, they may have the luxuries of life, but they lack the brains.

Some are accidental, some are planned - but to raise the child is no easy feat. And I think the permeation of technology and the shift in priorities is mostly to blame - technology itself isn't bad, but being so heavily engrossed in technology, overly reliant on nannies and whatnot is what's PROBABLY leading to this moral breakdown.

Thankfully, not all people are like this. And this video hits home - if there are no people to do the dirty work, then everyone will be living in some filth. The fact that it's stigmatized is insane.

By your numbers they should be pulling in 124k per year, taking the heavy weight lifter category. Which is more than software developers, or data analysts who according to the same sources pull in 110k on average. Is it impossible for a manual worker to pull in that much?
