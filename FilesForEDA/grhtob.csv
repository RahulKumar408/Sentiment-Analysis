An Islamic state is simply too difficult for Pakistan to achieve. Secularism, and then slowly turn that into Islamism is our best bet.

Islam is ingrained deeply into the identity of Pakistan. Without Islam you cannot deny that our country would not exist, and without Islam now as the dominant unifier we would surely see balkanisation.

Mindset is important, and for the development of our country it must surely change. We must encourage and actively promote education and erudition but religion cannot be left out. 

If you look at many secular and areligious countries today, liberalism is rampant. And this (especially for the identity of the country) can do more harm than good. 

I see in the future that if Pakistan is to succeed religion must play a different role. As in being more of a personal, individual matter. For the morals and laws would not come from mullahs and imams but instead from state guidance.

Mindset is important in that it lays down priorities, priorities in order to help improve our country for the betterment of all its citizens. But at the moment these priories are completely erroneous. And it would take a massive collective effort to change this.",1,-5,1590598077.0

frzmpjp,t1_frzkla7,"Changing a mindset doesn't equate to things getting better or worse. Secularism may solve a few problems but will bring a host of new problems as well. Turkey actually faces an identity crisis because of the ideological clash of secularists against non-secularists. India is being taken over by literal racist fascists. This trend is also visible in many European countries which are moving towards more right wing ideologies and all of these countries are secular. Secularism is not this miracle cure, it simply is an alternative, which may end up making things worse because it is completely incompatible with Pakistan. I've elaborated further on this point here.

Yes men should not dictate the way women dress. In the same way, Men should also lower their gaze. We are a Muslim country and we follow Islamic rulings.

Yes I agree that it is not big enough to be a political problem, but it is still significant. The identity crisis I'm talking about is actually a much more nuanced topic which includes geography as well. Turkey even has a problem identifying as either European or Asian. That also relates to how the eastern parts of turkey are more religious than the western. 

>I don't know if you have ever been to Turkey or know Turkish culture much but you are absolutely misinformed about the understanding of secularism here. Most of the population are Muslims who don't really care about the practices but nobody can push for ''anti-secularism''

I'm going to have to simply disagree with you here. I know I am not Turkish so I don't know the ground reality, but perhaps this actually requires a distant view which can look to Turkey as a whole. Turkey is split in between having religious Muslims and non-religous Muslims and the split is about even. I actually agree with you that the religious Muslims do not have a political campaign against secularism and neither do all the religious Muslims even care about secularism that much, but the ones that do definitely exist and they are not simply insignificant. I even remember one of the parliament speakers of Erdogans party spoke about how Turkey should have an Islamic constitution which became quite a controversy. Erdogan used the religious Muslims for his political base and that is evident, he simply did not speak out against secularism but perhaps someone else in the future might, and I'm pretty sure most of the religious Muslims will rally behind that. It is evident there is a general attitude many people have to move towards a more Islamicized Turkey, that simply cannot be denied. 

I also have a Turkish friend who I discuss general ideas with so I'm not just speaking from thin air. It sounds cliche I know but you're going to have to take my word for it. In a way, it kind of even reinforces my points because he has entirely differing opinions than you in regards to Islam in Turkey.",7,5,1590667301.0

It is quite evident Pakistan was built for Islam. I think you may be mistaking the words ""Muslims"" and ""Islam"" as being contrasting. The entire idea of Pakistan was that ""Muslims"" would get a homeland. When a group of people choose to identify themselves as ""Muslims"", rather than their ethnicity, they are putting precedence on their identity of belong to a religion. That religion is Islam. Even the definition of a ""Muslim"" means one who submits to God while ""Islam"" means submission. I mean, if it wasn't for Islam, there would be no Muslims. There is no other way to look at it except that if it wasn't for Islam, Pakistan didn't need to be created. 

> Also, when it was created it was ""Dominion of Pakistan"" not an islamic republic.. All the theological islamic republic stuff was added on later... 

This wasn't because Pakistan would not be going towards an Islamic government system, but rather that it was still in its infancy. Even then, the ""Dominion of Pakistan"" is still an Islamic country simply because of the fact that it was built for the identity of Islam. And to confirm this, here is a quote which solidifies my argument. 

*""The Constitution of Pakistan is yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly, I do not know what the ultimate shape of the constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be of a democratic type,* ***embodying the essential principles of Islam.

> If you make it a secular country Pakistan would still exist for Pakistanis. The land/ people/ institutions are not going to evaporate into thin air. 

Yes the institutions would not evaporate, but the spirit and identity of a nation would. This will lead to the inevitable decline of institutions as well. The simple core reason Pakistan exists today is because our forefathers decided to identify themselves as ""Muslims"" first before their ethnicity. Islam is the Volksgeist of Pakistan.

The proof is clear as day. What is Pakistan? What defines Pakistan? Is it just the word Pakistan which constitutes a nation? Why was it created? Why did it need to be created? If we ignore these things, all Pakistan will stand for nothing and will be an empty husk. The soul is gone.

Nations face problems. So do Islamic states, so do secular states. The problems you face is not always because you are either an Islamic state or a secular state. The problems Pakistan faces is not because it is an Islamic state and Pakistan will face the exact same problems even if it becomes secular. To think secularism will automatically solve the issues is naive and shows a lack of understanding of what the actual problems are.",2,2,1590607684.0

fs1kh6w,t1_fs1gw3g,"Firstly, escaping Hindu oppression was not the sole reason nor the core reason for Pakistans creation. Escaping Hindu oppression was just one of main points talked about in the Two Nation Theory. And in the Two Nation Theory, it also details Islamic principles, ideals and governance based on them and even the concept of the ""Ummah"". Just look into the views of Allama Iqbal, who is a main contributor to the Two Nation Theory and is also considered to be the one who actually brought forth the initial idea of Pakistan, which the Qauid made into reality. 

Second, a secular Islamic country is an oxymoron. You can be a Muslim majority country sure, but it is no longer an ""Islamic"" country. As I explained before, both Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal wanted an Islamic state on the basis of the Two Nation Theory. Even the majority of people in Pakistan want this. To simply abandon that would be going against the very foundations of Pakistan, but also going against the will of the people. 

I've already quoted this before but this once again proves what Pakistan was always meant to be.

But the fact that Pakistan was founded as an Islamic nation doesn't necessitate that it stays that way. Hell, loads of countries were founded by conquest, genocide etc, doesn't mean they should continue following those values Jinnah and Iqbal aren't gods whose ideas can't be challenged, they're men with great acheivements and ideas but it's perfectly fine to evolve beyond their ideologies.   


So if we're discussing whether Pakistan should be secular or Islamic, it should be on the basis of whether shifting to a secular system would bring more practical harm or benefit in the present and future. Simply saying this: Pakistan's founding as an Islamic nation can't be used to justify its continued existence as such. ""Abandoning the foundations"" of Pakistan doesn't have to be a terrible thing. Building new societies and making progress requires some dimunition of traditional principles.

Its true some good can come from adapting and evolving, but harm can come as well. Sticking to the roots is of value and not only is it safe, its efficient but it can also cause stagnation. So the best thing is probably a balance in between.

However, I think people don't understand or even realize just how significant Islam is in the political realm. Islam is not like other religions in the sense where it is a ""Private"" religion, but it comes packaged with political, judicial and government rulings. By going towards secularism, you may think you can preserve Islam by making it private, but it actually undermines it. By separating religion from state, you are literally ripping off entire parts of Islam. That is not acceptable and nor will the general population of Pakistan ever accept that either. Secularism or mainly western secularism is simply ""Incompatible"" with Islam. I elaborated on this point here. Its a long read but its quite insightful on understanding Islam and secularism.

This is a matter of Conservatism and Liberalism. The reason I mentioned these ideals in the first place is because this is how the usual argument plays off. I can counter your statement with a conservative point and it would be neutralized, and then you can put forward another liberal viewpoint and it will go on. However, Islamic governance or Islam in general is not part of that spectrum. The position of Islam in the spectrum is perceived as being conservative in the modern day, however it does not lie in the same category at all. This is why I mentioned that there must be a balance between conservatism and liberalism. That is the way forward and Islam has always facilitated that. Islam gives freedom for adapting and innovating in certain fields while it also lays down a solid foundation for people to stand.

> I wasn't arguing that Islam would be equally powerful, influential or complete under a secular model. My assertion suggested that Muslims would enjoy their basic human rights. The preservation of Islamic power is a different issue altogether. 

Sure, I agree. But the basic human rights for all members of Pakistan is preserved under Islamic rule as well. There are strict rulings on the protection and autonomy of minorities and non-Muslims in Islam. If people fail to implement them, you can't blame Islam. Because if you don't solve the root of the problem, which is education, then switching to secularism won't solve anything. I mean, just look at India. 

> I do accept the premise that a secular state would undermine Islamic power to some degree. But you're not proving why that's necessarily a moral wrong. You have to actually compare the tangible consequences and benefits of absolute Islamic power. You're assuming that a secularist would see the undermining of Islamic influence as a harm in and of itself. 

If you don't consider undermining Islam as a moral wrong, and need ""tangible"" consequences for it to be considered immoral, then you are speaking of something similar to Utilitarianism. And going down that path is a slippery slope.  Essentially your argument becomes that the ends justify the means. 

Islam provides objective morals. It is unchanging and uncompromising and in that sense it gives it inherent value because it was the same thousands of years ago and will be the same thousands of years in the future. For a person who doesn't follow Islam, their morals are entirely subjective. Like you just mentioned ""tangible consequences"" as a prerequisite for undermining Islam, but for Muslims, the simple act of undermining Islam is the most immoral thing you can do. I'm not assuming the secularists would see it that way, but I'm telling you it is undeniably immoral for Muslims to do such a thing. So you can't expect Muslims to simply be okay with secularism. That is my point. 

> Your point about the general Pakistani not wanting a secular state is a truistic one. Like, yes, you're right, but this can't be a reason to denounce the benefits of a secular state. This just becomes an appeal to popular opinion. Ofc secularization won't happen in present day Pakistan. It'd only happen if there was significant support for it. I think the point of the discussion is to argue about whether we should work towards that goal or not. 

Yes I agree that the appeal to popular opinion is not a solid argument when it comes to proving something, however, in the realm of democracy, it is. The main reason I mentioned the popular opinion is that if you really want secularism, you would be going against the will and wishes of the majority of Pakistanis. And I mean an overwhelming majority. 

I want to be clear. In my entire argument, I don't see secularism as an ideal as being inherently wrong in terms of governance. But secularism is simply an ""alternative"". And I emphasize the world ""alternative"" because it is not something better or worse, just a different form of governance. It may solve a few issues but will bring issues of its own. Every single one of the problems Pakistan faces can be solved by staying an Islamic republic or even by becoming a fully Islamic state. Secularism is simply not necessary.",8,1,1590665060.0
