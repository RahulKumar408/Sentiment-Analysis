It's like trying to replace the foundation of a building that's already built. Not gonna happen, unless you topple it and start over from the very beginning. Such issues cannot be addressed from one-off occurrences like this. And for them to be addressed people need to have the self-awareness to recognize the issue in the first place.

If someone is *this* indoctrinated, you'll have better luck destroying a brick wall with your bare fists. A suitable mindset can only be cultivated over time, by raising awareness through videos such as this. It was an outrageous situation, and the poster decide to post it - nothing wrong with that. I don't see why you're taking issue with it, to be honest.

If you try to be upfront with these kinds of people, they will literally lynch you. History has proven that time and time again. They will not listen no matter how hard you try.

People will listen to their emotions and their existing notions even if you bring up irrefutable evidence against them. It's useless.

hqq8pyh,t1_hqq7mjn,"That could have definitely worked. I mean, you never know - it's always worth a shot.

Personally, I am not knowledgeable enough to do that in the moment, and, just like the people I'm trying to convince, after a certain point I end up resorting to emotions and pre-existing notions, albeit ones built on a comparatively broader perspective. Do note that I am trying to remedy this.

Well anyway, that is why I have begun to practice the teaching of the hadith ""He who keeps silent is saved."" And indeed, what a lifesaver it has been.",5,3,1640985163.0

hqwyi6r,t1_hqwu44h,"I am not being an apologist for mob lynchers.You do realize this tradition has a vast information about what the Prophet (SAW) did.We even know that he (SAW) took a bite from a piece of meat from the same place his wife took a bite from and drank from the exact same side of the cup she drank from.Abu Bakr (RA) said that he was afraid of leaving sunnah prayers because he was afraid of going astray.Sunnah prayers are those that the Prophet (SAW) did but they aren't mandatory on us nor will we be asked about them or punished for not doing them.You are just an ignorant fool,the Quran literally says in Surah Aal I imran,Ayah 31,Allah says to the Prophet (SAW) to say that if you should love Allah,then follow me.Until we accept that the only way for us to truly follow this deen is by following the Prophet (SAW).If we don't accept that,then good luck ever stopping mob lynching because you open the door to other than the way of the Prophet (SAW),you open a door for Iblis to come and destroy us.You can't be a Muslim and not follow the Prophet (SAW).You don't have real iman if you think that there is any other acceptable way.It doesn't mean you become hateful towards anyone who chooses another way,but you can't be a hypocrite and say that you believe in Allah and his messenger yet you live as if you don't believe in them.This madness is only gonna increase the more and more we abandon the way this tradition has spread.You wanna hate on me for saying this then fine,but like be honest with yourself,who are you fooling? You can't fool Allah,you are only fooling yourself.Don't think that I am going extreme,I am not worshipping the Prophets or anything like that,but we can't be ignorant in thinking that in this religion,you have other ways of doing it.That goes against what a Muslim has to believe.",6,1,1641113156.0

hqwztss,t1_hqwyi6r,"How old are you? 15? 18? Your thought process makes no sense. Basically all I read is exactly what the Salafi's or Wahabi's believe; ""if you don't follow my Brand of Islam, you're a Munafiq"". Also, I am not hating on you, you can't break down my argument with logic so you bring emotion, exactly what fanatics do by calling others ignorant or a fool by not thinking deeply at the subject matter. I have learnt nothing from you. Where did I say I don't have love for the Prophet? It's people like you on the more extreme who's next step is to point fingers and call out Blasphemy.

And then you quote the Quran where it literally means you follow the humanity that the Prophet proposed for mankind along with your own logic in the situation at the time. Allah's requirements are so simple, be a good human being to others and here's the 100,000+ examples I have sent through the ages with the Prophet being the last one. You can't completely emulate another person, just their good habits no less someone you have never met or never known in a completely different time of the age and not knowing their culture or their struggles. I am going to deplore you to do some introspection because if this is your world view, in a few years you will be just a slightly less extreme version of the Mullah in this video.

Even if you don't believe or believe in whatever thought process in your theological output, that's between you and Allah. Real iman for others doesn't need a measure from another faulty human being aka you or anyone else. My relationship with Allah is my own and I don't need to validate anyone, especially you. Btw, usually those people who virtue signal the most are the most insecure by nature. Also what tradition? You think the Gulf Arabs think of you as an Arab? You're a person from the Sub-Continent with a mixed Indian heritage. Relax.",7,1,1641114219.0
