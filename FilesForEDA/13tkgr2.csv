jlxgsmf,t3_13tkgr2,"""What was the fault?""  
  
I am posting this after seeing all the evidence on the request of an overseas friend.  
  
These are foreign donors of Tehreek-e-Insaaf and Shaukat Khanum. Neither is active on any social media and has never been a part of any demonstration.  
  
A week ago today, an unknown number sent him a shameful video and pictures in which his widowed sister and 13-year-old niece living in a city in Punjab were completely naked in a police station. Even this 13-year-old girl has been photographed completely naked and sitting on the lap of various policemen.  
  
When this friend contacted Pakistan, it was found that this news was true and the family members had tried to hide the matter due to embarrassment and not to disturb this friend abroad.  
  
Long story short, after giving an affidavit, he will not take any legal action on this matter and will not provide any funding to Tehreek-e-Insaf or Shaukat Khanum in the future. Her sister and niece reached home.  
  
This friend immediately transferred his sister-in-law and her loved ones abroad using his connections and now mentioning this incident, narrated this incident..  
  
Their financial status is such that they can be any big lawyer in Pakistan, but they have no faith in the justice system of Pakistan and according to them, even if the criminals are punished, they will be suspended or dismissed or go to jail. They will be released or may be rehabilitated and awarded with rewards and honors as happened with the criminals involved in May 25 and Model Town tragedy.  
  
However, they say that whenever an independent and impartial commission is formed in Pakistan or abroad to investigate the circumstances of these atrocities, they will definitely take up the matter with all the evidence and as far as possible their widows. The sister and niece must also cope with the shock of this incident. This 13-year-old girl tried to commit suicide twice after this incident and is now being treated by a psychiatrist abroad.  
  
His only question is whether foreign funding was such a big crime that his widowed sister and niece were subjected to this brutality.  
  
He also said that how long the people of Pakistan and the government of this group of infidels are taking Pakistan towards, how long will the nation watch this spectacle. If they are there today, God forbid, tomorrow any of us may also be a victim of this brutality..!!",0,11,1685270722.0

"" قصور کیا تھا ""  
  
ایک اورسیز دوست کی درخواست پر تمام تر شواہد دیکھنے کے بعد یہ پوسٹ کر رہا ہوں .  
  
یہ تحریک انصاف کے اور شوکت خانم کے فارن ڈونیٹر ہیں . نہ ہی کسی سوشل میڈیا پر ایکٹو ہیں اور نہ عملی طور پر کسی مظاہرے کا کبھی حصہ بنے .  
  
آج سے ایک ہفتے پہلے ایک نامعلوم نمبر سے انہیں شرمناک ویڈیو اور تصویریں بھیجی گئیں جس میں ان کی پنجاب کے ایک شہر میں مقیم بیوہ بہن اور 13 سالہ بھانجی کی کسی تھانے میں مکمل برہنہ تصاویر اور ویڈیو تھیں . یہاں تک کے اس 13 سالہ بچی کو مکمل برہنہ کر کے مختلف پولیس والوں کی گود میں بٹھا کر بھی تصویر بنائی گئی ہیں .  
  
جب ان دوست نے پاکستان رابطہ کیا تو معلوم ہوا کہ یہ خبر درست ھے اور فیملی کے لوگوں نے شرمندگی اور ان دوست کو بیرون ملک پریشان نہ کرنے کی وجہ سے بات چھپانے کی کوشش کی تھی ..  
  
قصہ مختصر ایک بیان حلفی دینے کے بعد کے وہ اس بات پر کسی قسم کی قانونی کاروائی نہیں کریں گے اور آئندہ تحریک انصاف یا شوکت خانم کو کسی قسم کی فنڈنگ بھی نہیں کرینگے ان کی بہن اور بھانجی گھر پہنچ گئیں .  
  
ان دوست نے فوری طور پر اپنی بہن بھانجی اور ان کے عزیزوں کو اپنے تعلقات استعمال کرتے ہوۓ بیرون ملک منتقل کروالیا اور اب اس بات کا تذکرہ کرتے ہوۓ یہ واقع بیان کیا ..  
  
ان کی مالی حثیت ایسی ھے کہ یہ پاکستان میں کوئی بھی بڑے سے بڑا وکیل کرسکتے ہیں لیکن انہیں پاکستان کے نظام انصاف پر کسی قسم کا بھروسہ نہیں اور بقول انکے اگر مجرمان کو سزا ہو بھی گئی تو معطل یا برطرف کردیے جائینگے یا جیل جاکر پھر چھوڑدیے جائینگے یا ہوسکتا ہے دوبارہ بحال بھی ہوجائیں اور انعام و اکرامات سے بھی نوازے جائیں جیسا کے 25 مئی اور ماڈل ٹاؤن سانحے میں شامل مجرمان کے ساتھ ہوا .  
  
البتہ ان کا کہنا ھے کہ جب کبھی بھی پاکستان یا بیرون ملک کوئی آزاد اور غیر جانبدار کمیشن ان بربریت کے حالات کی تحقیقات کے لیے تشکیل دیا گیا یہ تمام تر ثبوتوں کے ساتھ اس معملے کو ضرور اٹھائیں گے اور جب تک ممکن ھے ان کی بیوہ بہن اور بھانجی بھی اس واقعے کے صدمے سے سنبھال جائیں . اس 13 سالہ بچی نے اس واقعے کے بعد دو دفع خودکشی کی کوشش کی ھے اور اب بیرون ملک ماہر نفسیات کے زیر علاج ھے .  
  
انکا ایک ہی سوال ھے کہ کیا فارن فنڈنگ اتنا بڑا جرم تھا کہ ان کے اس عمل کے باعث انکی بیوہ بہن اور بھانجی کو اس درندگی کا نشانہ بنایا گیا ..  
  
انکا یہ بھی کہنا تھا کہ ہمارا پاکستان والے اور اس بیغیرتوں کے ٹولے کی حکومت پاکستان کو جس طرف لے کر جارہے ہیں قوم کب تک یہ تماشا دیکھے گی . اگر آج وہ ہیں تو الله نہ کرے کل ہم میں سے بھی کوئی اس درندگی کا شکار ہوسکتا ھے ..!!",0,0,1685270712.0
