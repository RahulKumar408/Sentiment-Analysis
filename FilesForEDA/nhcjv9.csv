gyvvrbe,t3_nhcjv9,"Political scientist and professor of international relation at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, John J. Mearsheimer, wrote a book in 2006 called *[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy)*. In it, he methodically describes how the US media and its foreign policy are influenced by Isreal through financial and other means.

A [student at MIT](https://twitter.com/h_jackson_/status/1395406952180633601) used [machine learning](https://github.com/hollyjackson/NYT_Content_Analysis) to analyze NYT coverage and found that references to Palestinians were >1.5x likelier to use violent language than references to Israelis. Reports also referred to Palestinians >2x more frequently in passive voice & were consistently more negative, which minimizes the responsibility of Israeli aggressors. 

In an undercover Al Jazeera investigation, [pro-Isreal lobbyists were caught boasting about how much their money influences Washington](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/11/ilhan-omar-israel-lobby-documentary/). 

> David Ochs, founder of HaLev, which helps send young people to American Israel Public Affairs Committee‚Äôs annual conference, described for the reporter how AIPAC and its donors organize fundraisers outside the official umbrella of the organization, so that the money doesn‚Äôt show up on disclosures as coming specifically from AIPAC. He describes one group that organizes fundraisers in both Washington and New York. ‚ÄúThis is the biggest ad hoc political group, definitely the wealthiest, in D.C.,‚Äù Ochs says, adding that it has no official name, but is clearly tied to AIPAC. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the AIPAC group. It makes a difference; it really, really does. It‚Äôs the best bang for your buck, and the networking is phenomenal.‚Äù (Ochs and AIPAC did not immediately return The Intercept‚Äôs requests for comment.)

> Without spending money, Ochs argues, the pro-Israel lobby isn‚Äôt able to enact its agenda. ‚ÄúCongressmen and senators don‚Äôt do anything unless you pressure them. They kick the can down the road, unless you pressure them, and the only way to do that is with money,‚Äù he explains. 

I think what SMQ said was a little too unpolished but if Bernie Sanders and Jeremy Corbyn can be accused of being anti-semetic for the slightest criticism of Isreal then a dark-skinned Muslim guy from Pakistan with a theatrical accent had no chance to begin with. lol",0,155,1621554499.0
