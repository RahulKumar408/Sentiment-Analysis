Wouldn't it be better for the country overall if the early elections are not called ? Infact, this time should be used by courts to launch cases against the opposition members for treason and working against the interest of Pakistan. This will make it difficult for the opposition to scramble for support on such short notice. It will also be a slap on the opposition and PTI will be one of the few elected parties to complete their full term.

Fuck this chaudhry system we have going on. Pakistan is a laughing stock thanks to these guys. At least Imran gave the country some dignity if nothing else. If you blame him for the cost of living crisis then you're even bigger dullards than I thought.
