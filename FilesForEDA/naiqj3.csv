gxy40o8,t3_naiqj3,"Although Khan very likely hasn't done it with this thinking behind it, but it's fitting he would quote what is one of the biggest Jewish leftist gatekeepers Israel's had in the US in history. Chomsky is de facto a Zionist, believing in Israel's mythical 'right to exist'. He's Jewish and also spent some years in his youth living on a settler kibbutz in Israel.

His modus operandi like the rest of the Jewish left has been to try and obfuscate the Adelsons, Kushners, AIPACs et al who puppeteer US foreign policy and distort it in favour of Israel and to portray Israel like some mindless dindu that will act nice once the West stops being mean or whatever else the typical Marxist line tends to be.

Anyhow Imran Khan is as fake as they get. The guy and the Pakistani establishment in general made 0 moves in preparation for India's Israel-like maneuvers in occupied Kashmir and has constantly thrown unconditional peace gestures India's way since then. He's a coward and so is the state he represents and were it people like him in charge of Palestine, the capitulation/surrender that Yasser Arafat pulled off in the Oslo Accords in the 1990s (acquiescing to Israeli occupation, dropping resistance without any promises of a state) would once again be witnessed.

Instead what we see is really noble and brave resistance right now from Palestine, supported by brave countries like Iran and its allies like Hezbollah. Not Pakistan, not that Israeli ally Turkey (not only because it has the Israeli embassy and trade ties, those are weak examples, but because it's been Israel's historical source of strategic depth in Syria and Iraq and has constantly helped Israel destabilize those two key Arab countries).",0,-1,1620884180.0
