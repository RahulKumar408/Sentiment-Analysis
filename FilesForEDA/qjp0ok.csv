How is that like Taiwan, where independence or reunification is mostly seen as a 'game of the upper classes' to regular people

[https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/14/asia/taiwan-china-taipei-people-intl-hnk/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/14/asia/taiwan-china-taipei-people-intl-hnk/index.html)

Taiwanese separatism is actually not being driven by the native aboriginals of Taiwan (as is the case for Palestine for example) but Han people (primarily pro-DPP, Hoklo-speaking background) in Taiwan pushing to construct an artifical Taiwanese identity which itself is vague and they're confused to either mold it as a civic identity or ""Hoklo linguistic-identity"" or infuse it with Japanese-occupation colonial culture. It's essentially an identity crisis.

Aboriginal people in Taiwan strongly support the Kuomintang currently, which basically supports maintaining cross-strait relations with the PRC and maintaining Taiwan's status quo under the Constitution of the Republic of China (ROC). The aboriginal people were treated harshly during the Japanese occupation, so the fact that the DPP (the main rival of Kuomintang, and the main party pushing for independent Taiwan) bootlicks Japan is not going to help them gain support as well as being associated as mainly representing Hoklo-speaking ""interests"".

What needs to happen under reunification is to guarantee provincial government positions to Aboriginal representatives. Same thing China already does in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet.

An independent, pro-US Taiwan only helps the West in its colonial interests against the eastern bloc (WHICH INCLUDES PAKISTAN). If countries were to start making political decisions on the basis of naive idealism, this entire region would slip into chaos and instability.",7,3,1635724478.0

hitwv16,t1_hitr2ax,"The fact that Taiwan doesn‚Äôt have any active conflict with China doesn‚Äôt delegitimize their independence movement in any way. My example of Kashmir and Palestine were crude and just to get a point across, I said as much in that comment as well.

And you base your entire argument for unified China based on what the Taiwanese Aboriginals want? That‚Äôs like 3% of the population.

As for the Eastern Bloc argument, I really couldn‚Äôt care less. I don‚Äôt view a people‚Äôs demand to self governance through some nationalistic angle. I support their movement for the same reason I support Kashmir, Palestine, and others. If the people want self-governance, they deserve self-governance. Your way of viewing everything through nationalistic goggles is how the congress viewed the Pakistan independence movement, how the Indian government views the Kashmir struggle, how Israel views the Palestinian struggle, and generally how every oppressor views those against them. If you view their actions as bad and evil then you need to look within yourself and see what that means for you as well.",8,1,1635727476.0
hiu165r,t1_hitwv16,"Mate, I don't know what you think Taiwan's 'demand to self governance' is exactly. Average western media would led you to believe that the entirety of Taiwan wants to be separated, that's not really true, the situation there is there's a small group of people want to separate and a smaller group against it, vast majority either doesn't care or is on the fence. Polls show this. By that logic, making a 'crude example' as you did, Pakistan should let Balochistan be independent too.",9,1,1635729703.0
hiu29d9,t1_hiu165r,"A small group of people?

> Asked about Taiwan‚Äôs future, 50.1 percent of the public support maintaining the ‚Äústatus quo,‚Äù 38.9 percent back independence and 4.7 percent favor joining China.

89% of the people either want to maintain the current self-governance structure or gain even more distance from PRC.

hiud0o0,t1_hiu29d9,"The moral idea of self-determination doesn‚Äôt justify everything. The US confederacy also ‚Äúself-determined‚Äù to go for independence. The Austrian Anschluss was decided through an Austrian plebiscite. You need to make a decision whether to support it or not based on the individual cases. And the stats you quoted just confirm that the majority prefer the status quo to remain or are indifferent anyway so the point about self determination doesn't really hold. If Taiwan wants to be independent so badly, they could start by declaring it.

With that said, the whole 'free Taiwan' thing looks like moral posturing to me; implicitly playing directly into the hands of bloodthirsty western warhawks but justifying it on moral grounds like 'we should support secessionist forces in Taiwan because democracy'. It's impossible to understand this thinking other than that your, and only your morals trump everything else, be it war, poverty, or hunger.",2,1,1635735889.0
hiugtau,t1_hiud0o0,"The stats I quoted show that the vast majority of Taiwanese people don‚Äôt want any more closeness to China than they currently have (which is minimal), which is more than your earlier ‚Äúonly a small group‚Äù claim. Taiwan operates independently of China and for all intents and purposes is an independent nation with its own army, government, president, etc.

As far as Taiwan‚Äôs self-determination goes, the basis of it lies in the age old communist vs democratic struggle. I for one, believe in the democratic way of life and support people‚Äôs right to self-determination the way they see fit. My religious and social views don‚Äôt align with the communist way of life.

As for morals, well, my or anyone else‚Äôs morals don‚Äôt really matter when they go against the interests of the majority of concerned party. I accept the Afghan‚Äôs choice of (or inaction against) the Taliban regime even though I don‚Äôt like the Taliban. Had I been older at the time, I would have supported East-Pakistan‚Äôs call to self govern. I support Kashmiris‚Äô right to self determination, whether that‚Äôs with India or Pakistan or neither. I support the Palestinians cause to self-determination. All of these I support because their people want as much.",3,1,1635737903.0
