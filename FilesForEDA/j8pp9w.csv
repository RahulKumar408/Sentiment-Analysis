I once bought a toy for 50 rupees. Keep in mind that 50 used to be a decent sum back in the days and took me a whole month to save up. Sadly, the toy in question (a toy truck, to be precise) broke down within hours! Went to the shopkeeper, who I thought was a nice fellow, but when I asked for a replacement he showed me his big, angry, scary eyes that I'll never forget and basically told me to shove off. When I begged and told him how I was saving up that money for a month he literally pushed me out of his shop because I was creating quite a racket, apparently.

Child abuse?!

Needless to say; sh!t like that sticks with you for life! Which brings us to my rule numero uno:

Never trust anyone.
