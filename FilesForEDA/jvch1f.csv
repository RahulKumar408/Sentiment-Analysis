Calling all malala lovers ... Could you please answer that why aitzaz never got acknowledged the way malala got? Agree that she is a female and was trying to get education but this dude gave up his life to protect 100 of students. Go out and ask anyone in the west if they know about him and then ask them about malala. 

People ask me that why i hate malala. I don't hate her. I respect her. I hate the spotlight she got (and no one else got) and I am calling it out now she will be playing an important role in future in Pakistan's politics.",0,2,1605639304.0

well, in fact, they do show it

those 8 dehshatgards included old men and kids. sure the media is going to show you guys those kids and old innocent men who had nothing to do with the separatist movement.



don't even get me started into death squads. for some insight, read into the army's cuck, Siraj Raisani's doings in Balochistan. and he's only the tip of the iceberg.

gckb82o,t1_gck72ru,"Fam don't be dense. If there's a genocide going on in Balochistan, even if Pakistani media stays silent, **reputable** international media would have said something. Indian media is BS so of course nobody will take their claims seriously. But do go ahead and share some Reuters, Al Jazeera, BBC or Guardians articles on the genocide you believe is occurring. Or are they all compromised by the ISI and only the Indian media is mighty enough to talk about it? 

If you can't find any, then maybe you should stop reading Times of India, Hindustan Times and whatever other Indian nonsense you've corrupted your mind with.

And make sure you know what a genocide is before replying, if you do.",5,12,1605576218.0
