This is a myth created by Indians to explain how they were colonized.   
You can't divide something that was NEVER united.   
It's like saying Europe used ""Divide and Rule"" for Africa.... Africa was never a country so how can you ""divide and rule"" it?  


>We treated East Pakistan as colony and so called development of 60s happened on the back of East Pakistan

No we didn't, we invested money there, we caved into their tantrums, hell Pakistan is the only government they have had in the past 500 years that DIDN'T cause a famine. MILLIONS of them died due to famine in 74 due to the mismanagement of their new government. But since that doesn't fit the narrative of ""Pakistan bad"" so it never gets mentioned. Think about that, more Bengalis died from the mismanagement of Mujibur Rahman in 74 then the war. But what do you hear? ""ThReE GrOzIllIoN bRaZiLlIoN dEeEeEaD iN 71""    


> Nukes will save West Pakistan if we do not learn from pre 71 lessons

We have learned from 71. We are STILL a proud multiethnic state that is built around tolerance for its ethnicities. Unlike the Ethnostate that is Bangladesh, where the first thing they did was take citizenship away from Urdu speakers since their land is only for Bengalis.

h6ih6y4,t1_h6cplyf,"Bro please check the current loan amount as it stands today, then look at the current gdp of Pakistan and calculate for yourself how long it will take to pay back those loans. By then China will have taken many more things from Pakistan as interest on the amount. CPEC from an Indian point of view isn’t a problem because it’ll help Pakistan, it’s more because it will give China sea access on another side and hence threaten India’s sovereignty. You could research a little thing called the string of pearls to understand more of what I speak. Also, while you’re at it, check out some videos on the Chinese debt trap, videos can originate from a neutral country of your choice. India is just doing in Balochistan recently what Pakistan has been doing in Kashmir for years. Albeit Indian progress in that regard is decades behind Pakistan’s.",4,0,1627246344.0

h5yhzqw,t1_h5y9gbf,Dude East Pakistan sepration was majorly our own fault.  They wanted Bangla as official language because a large population of bengalis don't speak urdu unlike West Pakistan. Bhutto straight up denied giving Mujib ur Rehman his rightfully earned government how fucked is that? I still see some racism against Bengalis to this day. 1971 was our  incompetence and fault.

h5ymj9f,t1_h5yhzqw,"Like I said, we made mistakes, but it wasn't all our fault.   
They wanted Bangla as an official language, despite all other ethnicities not getting theirs, we gave it to them. Yet they still cry babied about it. What Bhutto did was f-ed I will never defend him but he did that for is personal benefit. A normal Pakistani didn't do that. Either way, Mujib was going to separate Pakistan anyways. He was already meeting with Indians even before the elections. He was hoping to do it while he was PM, but he didn't get that chance.   
Racism against Bengalis? is that why millions of them are living in Pakistan? We haven have a youtuber who wears a Bangladesh flag Tshirt and makes videos in Pakistan. Could you imagine a Pakistani wearing a Pakistan flag tshirt and making videos in Bangladesh? He would be lynched so fast.   


We did learn from our mistakes. We are a multi party, multi ethnic, nuclear state. Not an ethnostate that has denied its people citizenship because they were not Bengali.   
I have no ill will towards them, I am just sick of the ""everything is Pakistan's fault"" crowd.   
Pakistan made mistakes, but it also did lots of good things. Again, we were the only government they have had in recent history that didn't gift them with a famine that would go on to kill millions.",5,6,1626839563.0

The modern Pakistani army has effectively beaten the TTP in Pakistan and has succesfully dismantled their terror cells here in the matter of a decade. Better than what the US has done in the past 20 years in Afghanistan. Also how come we are so bad in your eyes but you shoot down your own Choppers and lose a pilot to us?
