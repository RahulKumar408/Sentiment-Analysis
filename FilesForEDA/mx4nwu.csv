He will be in this same living situation for a long time probably, but he has not been sentenced yet, only convicted.

here in the US resisting arrest can often times legally justify extreme force, however the force that the officer used was deemed so excessive that the officer was convicted of 2nd degree murder, which means: *murder that is not premeditated, or murder that is caused by the offender's reckless conduct that displays an obvious lack of concern for human life.*",1,6,1619230170.0
