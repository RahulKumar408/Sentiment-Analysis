The initial shots during the tackle hit around his left shoulder or arm, maybe most of them even hopefully missed... but the final 3 or 4 while he was laying on the ground 100% hit him. I really do hope he survives because that's a lot of punishment to take up close like that. It explains why after all those times walking over him he never fired again at least.",4,9,1552684857.0

**Naeem Rashid was braver than most men ever could dream to be.** He charged a **terrorist** who was armed to the teeth with military grade hardware. I doubt a coward who hides on reddit and spews Islamophobic dogwhistles would know anything about bravery.

I looked through your comment history since I had already RES tagged you for saying some other Islamophobic things like:

They arrest people for tweets and steak knives. Their economy is shit. Their armed forces are weak. It’s not really even close. India is ahead of England. 😂](https://np.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/awncoz/the_uk_isnt_superior_to_america_and_people_need/ehnrcc4)

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

not sure if your experience has been the same but in the Gulf countries I find that the Levantine Arabs (Lebanese, Syrians, Jordanians, Palestinians) tend to be the most blatantly racist towards desis, guess it's the only thing they can feel superior (being Arab in a country with a racial hierarchy) - the Emiratis were mostly aloof (kept to themselves and didn't mingle outside their groups) and were quite uncommon anyway. it's weird because here in Canada all the Arabs (Syrians mostly) have been nothing but respectful.",2,3,1640531412.0

Both domestic and foreign. So please try not to take what I’m going to say or have said as some patriotic heart thumping. 

Whether you like it or not, it is an absolute fact that we live in the most peaceful time in human history. And it would be remiss if we didn’t recognize the U.S’s efforts in getting it to that point. And if we’re looking at World War 2 as a divergent point for what the world is going to look like, then the only option from what I’m getting from y’all is for the U.S to take a complete step back and not police the world. Right?

Only they literally tried a decade or two earlier and it didn’t work out. Russia would’ve ran rampant because they’re definitely not going to take a step back, and Britain likely wouldn’t have gave up it’s massive colonial empire so quickly.

And if the U.S didn’t develop Nukes first and show the world just how devastating they are, we wouldn’t be living in a MAD world where large scale wars between nuclear countries are generally seen an absolute last option.

Like, y’all are right I for sure don’t get to choose. And the U.S has done insanely fucked up shit since World War 2 and even still to a degree. What I’m trying to say that even if they didn’t do any of that stuff, things would overall be worse. That’s a tough pill to swallow, I know.

gm0r71u,t3_lclxka,"They have totally dehumanized Pakistanis (Muslims) to the point that their most watched TV channel got fined in the UK for airing [hate speech](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/23/indian-news-channel-fined-in-uk-for-hate-speech-about-pakistan).

This was what the regulatory body’s report stated:

>	Republic TV was fined £20,000 for airing a segment on its UK service, which conveyed the view that all Pakistani people are terrorists, including “their scientists, doctors, their leaders, politicians […] Even their sports people”.

>	Ofcom said it had received multiple complaints from viewers for the “highly pejorative references to members of the Pakistani community (eg continually referring to them as ‘filthy’)” on Goswami’s show

>	 In the programme, the presenter and some of his guests conveyed the view that all Pakistani people are terrorists, including that: “their scientists, doctors, their leaders, politicians all are terrorists. Even their sports people”; “every child is a terrorist over there. Every child is a terrorist. You are dealing with a terrorist entity”. One guest also described Pakistani scientists as “thieves”, while another described Pakistani people as “beggars”. In the context of these criticisms, the presenter, addressing Pakistan and/or Pakistani people, said: “We make scientists, you make terrorists”.

>	A third guest, General Sinha said, “Oh you useless people. Beggars. Oh beggars, oh beggars. We will douse you with 1.25kg, .75kg-, with two inches. PoK8, PoK, we are coming to the PoK. We are coming to the Gilgit, Baltistan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa...We are going to come, be ready. People in your country are shivering with fear that the Indian army may come. We will barge inside your home in Baluchistan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in Karachi, in your area, in Multan, in Rawalpindi and kill you. From Lahore, from Karachi to Gilgit-Balistan when we will have control” 

>	Ofcom acknowledged that the programme included one Pakistani guest who expressed the view three times that the success of India’s space programme was “a victory for humanity” and “a matter of happiness”. The same guest welcomed any advances by India in technology, in education, in health and in protection of minorities and indicated that Pakistan wished to learn from Indian surgeons and cooperate in sectors such as education and technology. The programme presenter indicated that India’s advance in space technology was “the advancement of the whole world”. We took into account that the Pakistani guests made some strong criticisms of Indian policy and its leaders.

>	However, we considered the inclusion of limited “conciliatory” statements and brief comments which were highly critical of India by Pakistani guests failed to provide sufficient context and challenge. We considered that the overall tone of the discussion was provocative, comparing Pakistanis to donkeys and monkeys. We also noted that Pakistani contributors were repeatedly interrupted and afforded little time to make points which may potentially have provided challenge or context.

Not to even mention the extensive fake news network and agitprop actors like Tarek Fateh and Husain Haqqani on their payroll. 

Unfortunately most other groups in South Asia, especially Sikhs, buy into this kind of villainous rhetoric about Pakistan wholeheartedly so there is no point in reaching out for any kind solidarity as we will be rejected anyways and associating with us just hurts their cause.

There maybe some people who don’t support outright war against Pakistan but I don’t think there is any faction in the Indian political spectrum, left or right, that is willing to run on a platform of peace with Pakistan. Hating Pakistan has almost unanimous consensus as its the single most unifying factor, so much so that telling someone to “go to Pakistan” is the single biggest insult in India politics.

It’s unfortunate, and you may not agree with it, but as a Pakistani who is a huge proponent of normalization of ties with India it’s a reality that we have to contend with. And when one side goes so far beyond the rubicon then it’s in your best interest to prepare for the worst.",4,24,1612497423.0

They don't live in a bubble. They're falling over themselves to marry their kids to a nice bacha from Pakistan. They read and write Urdu more than locals do and have some sort of news on 24/7. They sent back 29.4 BILLION dollars in remittances this year to said friends and family. That number represents most of the country's foreign reserves. It would literally be worse in Pakistan right now if it wasn't for overseas Pakistanis because remittances are at an all-time high, nearly double. 

You morons think MQM's torture cells were better, even a start? Was it fun when factory workers showed up murdered in pieces in jute bags because the owner refused to continue paying protection money to them? Have you ever had goons show up to your door to tell you how to vote? Or had Zardari's minions tell you you have to move and sell your house because they're expanding Bilawal house into a presidential palace? Have you ever been robbed, told someone connected who happened to call to ask how you were and then had police hand deliver you your wallet after a week saying 'they recovered it'?

Imran Khan may be stupid and incompetent in a lot of ways, but *he's not looking to kill you because your land or business looks tasty*. He's not some feudal prick, or even some aspirational feudal lord turned politician. He doesn't have a favorite village or district or literal gang he's pulling minions from and funneling millions to. He's just some ass who used to play cricket, that frankly most of you ten years ago would have been falling over to compliment despite being an ass. You're bitching about your choices when *you have none* and you just don't want to be told what to do. The most Pakistani habit of all, having some stupid nukta you won't shut up about and won't be told to let go. Half this sub complains about hurr durr libs/burgers/elites not representing the country when you probably read and write less urdu than most overseas Pakistanis who make it a point to be educated in their culture and don't know a lick about your government or how it actually rules.

The first complete civilian transfer of government in this country was in 2013. For 66 years it was fucked with. 14% increase in the global money supply, transport costs globally at an all time high, supply chain disruptions all over the world, a global pandemic, ZOMG all IK's fault. Containers that used to cost 4000 dollars to transport are now 50k, if you can get them. I'm not some PTI fanboi, I'd rather he have lent his political capital to a statesman, but it's moronic the amounts of bitching and whining you hear. Of course, taxes will go up, of course your currency will be devalued, your country produces barely anything and has massive expenses that don't magically disappear with any administration. X days to corruption free! So what if it's not immediately true? Are you 5? Do you think you're ordering food? This is the first thing resembling a non-establishment politician we've had. You'd need ten or twenty years of this for substantial change. 

Social media and resentment is rotting your brain. *Better doesn't mean easier*. Half the things that used to go on in Pakistan would curdle your scrotes, and you slept through it, and weren't capable of doing anything but bitch then too. Do most of you even know who your mayor is? Who your union council members are? What ward you're in? If the police come after you unlawfully, do you know to call for example the Ombudsman? Do you even know what an ombudsman is? Do you participate in your government at all or do you just learn BS regurgitated American conservative political spectrum shit off Indian twitter like a human centipede of bad ideas and call it a day? What you need is a r/canconfirmiamindian so you can live your life's aspirations bitching about ABCD's and turning into uncles who yell over each other as conversation every time they meet.

What we lack is civic engagement and agency and actually seeing our problems and this sort of bitching is a distraction. There's a generation of educated, well informed, dedicated career civil servants that disappeared from government over the last 66 years. CSS candidates are falling year over year, apart from a brief uptick in 2020. It was 36k in 2015, and it's 18k now. If you know better, you *could* apply and be of service. If you can't do that you could try and participate anyway, like most of the world does. You're sitting getting khwaar online talking smack and politics, not knowing a lick about the sort of problems the country has and how deep they run. 

Container prices have tripled or quintupled in the pandemic, sorry, your tomatoes are going to be more expensive. You know what would help? Following up on canning units: 

http://www.agripunjab.gov.pk/system/files/01-Fruit%20and%20Vegetable%20Canning%201.pdf

We're one of very few countries that don't have extensive infrastructure for local canning, and the government hasn't followed up on these initiatives. Canning has an incredible effect on the price of vegetables, because you can grow more when the yields are highest for your particular crop, and wind up with a high quality nutritionally dense food product that's indefinitely shelf stable and that stabilizes your prices as a result. In fact, the world over, canned tomatoes are usually higher quality than getting tomatoes from the grocery store off season. It's a known, not highly technical solution, could do a lot of good, and has a local manufacturing base already, it just needs to be expanded and coordinated with You can call your local agricultural authorities and ask them what they need to get more of these initiatives off the ground. Would you know that's even an option if you haven't even bothered to look for solutions?

Tomatoes are a water thirsty crop, but they're high yield, so planting them all at once actually conserves things like water and curbs pesticide/fertilizer use instead of planting them all year and hoping for the best. Cooler times of the year mean less bugs and disease and rot. We actually get rainfall at a great time of year for tomatoes.

Did you know PTI and other parties in cooperation with them brought new laws to regulate water/irrigation for farming and it's supply, which hadn't been updated since 1873? These communities have waited forever for someone to even notice or follow through on feudal buffoons who controlled their access to water, and regulate settlements made along canals. Even if the law isn't perfect, at least someone is *bothering* to do something about it: 

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/790978-punjab-irrigation-minister-reveals-pti-govts-agricultural-reforms-farmer-rights

Maybe they could form a cooperative, like across the world, where farmer coops come together and coordinate their yields and irrigation and lobby for reform? Whoops, the Cooperative Societies Act of 1925 was only just significantly amended in 2020. I myself have been trying to start coops in other sectors off and on for nearly a decade, and there's no incentives, help or guidance, and very few people have enough experience to tell you what works outside of housing. And only now, considering farmer's coops are one of the staple political blocs across the world, and Pakistan should rightfully have one of the largest ever, is the government and media doing anything to actively educate and promote cooperatives amongst them: https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2021/10/17/the-need-for-farmer-cooperatives-in-pakistan/

Instead we've been steadily cutting into local farmers with reforms that decimate local industries in favor of larger business interests:
https://grain.org/en/article/6738-the-corporate-attack-on-pakistan-s-small-dairies

The investment is coming in now because the country is seen as more stable, and there are obviously underserved markets, but none of the local players can participate besides a select few, they can't afford to, and that both kills most of the local farmer's production, requires more spending to build up privately infrastructure that the public will have to subsidize eventually when we have to spend into the deficit it causes when large industrial farmers literally can't keep up with the demand because they killed most of the supply with laws that suit them and carve out their market to the detriment of others. 

Guess what happens when local farmers are strapped for cash because they're already cutting into their profits to process their goods? The price goes up massively, and they still don't earn enough to ramp up supply because they have no access to capital.

What stroke of the pen would solve this over even a decade if most of the country has no clue that it's happening? Farmers are wary of coops because they think it means losing control over their property, and they're right to be afraid, digitizing land records is a new initiative that nobody wanted or put their weight behind til recently. You're seeing people surge to the cities with their illgotten wealth because of it. Eventually they'll be taxed. You'd have to be some kind of stupid to think it'll fix itself overnight after 60 to 70 odd years of insanity, and still more day to day complications.",0,92,1635009425.0

Thank you for your concern and cry me a river, but let's face it, you can sit outside the window and look in all you want, but you can't claim to live the reality or know the pain that people who were born and live in this country go through each day. News flash, hundreds of thousands of people here do go abroad at some point in their lives for any purpose, they're not clueless villagers as you're trying to make them out to be. Many more are well versed with the policies and standards of living that exist abroad.

Not much wrong....until they start pretending they know more about Pakistan than you.

>The constitution still applies to me, my residence is not determining my Pakistaniat

That's the thing, I want us to abolish dual nationality. It has no place in our law waise bhi, ainwen exemptions ke liye we sign treaties. India has a dual nationality law and Indians who get another citizenship can apply for an indefinite visa (think of it as the overseas card NADRA issues) and enter and leave the country at will, start a business.

Every Pakistani feels like they know more, this is not an overseas problem. You could also then keep on going and say the rich should not vote for the poor, what does a rich person know about economic stress? Or the Sindhi should not vote for a Pashtun, because what does a Sindhi know about KP? Thats not how the world works sir, democracy *mein sab ki suni jaati hai* as long as the law applies.

>I want us to abolish dual nationality

I am an OP who has actively decided not to be a dual citizen, for my own personal reasons. But I don't see anything wrong with dual nationality. 9/10 Pakistanis don't pay taxes (everyone, citizen or noncitizen, pays indirect taxes when traveling in Pakistan, so no reason to argue with that). They are drawing representation without participation...that in my head is absolutely wrong. So pointing fingers at a small minority living outside, vs the millions who get to vote without contributing anything is a bullshit argument.

I used your own argument. According to you, because OPs don't live in Pakistan, they are barely  aware of the situation on the ground, so they shouldn't vote.

>PTI to be honest and good for the country?

People don't vote for PTI. People vote for IK. And yes, people still consider IK to be better for the country than others.

Anyway, I am not interested in a fight online man. You clearly hate PTI and that's fine, your choice but unless you can spout another name, one that's confidently believed to be better, many will not be changing their votes.

Also, calling everyone you disagree with as delusional isn't helpful or smart.",8,3,1634985393.0

Their governments still allow immigration despite nativist movements, the same as how Islamic countries like the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Indonesia allow Hindu migration. And how does this relate to the Indian occupation of Kashmir? 

>It's just that the population there doesn't resort to terrorism.

So I guess white supremacist terror and Western/Russian/Israeli/Indian atrocities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia, Syria and Myanmar (all of which far outweigh the death toll of Islamic terrorism) don't exist? 

>Also, most of the immigrants there are ""refugees"" from Islamic countries. Have you considered that?

The majority of immigrants in the West aren't Islamic refugees you dunce, they're economic migrants just like Indians are. For example in the USA, only 3 million refugees have entered since 1980 (out of 40 million total immigrants since 1980) and out of those only 13% are Muslim.",3,3,1565629120.0

2-3 years?

My father spent several years at different times in nothing but a tent along the border. (Throughout career) 

He spent almost 2 years in Siachen. (as a Captain) 

2 years in Swat. (as a Lt. Col) 

A year in Congo with the U.N

A year in Sudan. 

Some time in overlooking the fencing in Balochistan. 

And even the ""Luxuries"" were pretty crappy. The only things that could count as ""Luxury"" was maybe the Officers' Mess. Which was nothing more than a restaurant as you paid full price for everything. 

The houses were 95% of the times built from the British era and were somewhat renovated that someone could live in them. Some officers were lucky enough to get newer houses if they were constructed in some cantt (maybe a few). 

My father bought a Vitz in 2009 and he still drives it. 
Before that he had a Mehran.

Yeah. We definitely still have Captain HK, and maybe Mard-e-mom I think.

Here's the relevant part:

An Indian parliamentarian Ram Kumar Anand had also picked up the topic and revealed that the Indian army had failed to recapture the following Points:

Point 5353, Point Aftab 1, Point Saddle Bridge, Point Bunker Ridge, Shangruti, and Dhaulanag.

[Source: BBC article](http://archive.vn/n90F0).

>*On Wednesday, an Indian MP alleged that Pakistani troops were occupying six peaks on the Indian side of the LoC.The MP's claim followed a report in an Indian newspaper that a strategic peak, Point 5353, was under Pakistani occupation.The Indian army has refused to comment on the claim.*

It goes into more detail:

>India was locked in a ten-week long conflict with Pakistan last year, which began with a large-scale infiltration by Pakistan-backed forces on the Indian side of Kashmir.Following intense shelling and use of airpower, India claimed that it had cleared the intruders from all its territory.But Indian parliamentarian Ram Kumar Anand says six prominent peaks - Point 5353, Point Aftab 1, Point Saddle Bridge, Point Bunker Ridge, Shangruti and Dhaulanag - are still under Pakistani control.

So, India took back 2 of the 8 peaks, those being Tiger Hill and Tololing however lost more men and airforce assets and basicallt basically achieved nothing.",3,1,1620593624.0

In '65 pakistan citing India's loss with china launched offensive in Kashmir, in end result was a stalemate, pakistan lost much more than india, it failed to realise it's objective, got it's lands captured, barely managed to save lahore.

In 71, pakistan was committing literal genocide in Bangladesh, tens of millions of refugees were pouring into india, india had to do something.

Okay. I see . You may have a point. Well done. So-
1. India did bad. But india is perfectly happy with what she has and has no remorse over it.
2. Hyderabad didn't legally join Pakistan and as far as I know didn't even ask for instrument of accession. Atleast in its inception, indian Union was concieved as a secular entity. So , india will have no issue absorbing Hyderabad. Plus , how will Hyderabad connect with Pakistan? Especially after Pakistan had a war with India a year before in 47. Hyderabad was annexed one whole year later.
3. Pakistan , as far as i know is claiming Junagadh right now. There were legal fictions used for Junagadh too.
4.  At that time Sheikh Abdullah favoured Congress. Won't it be natural for a Kashmiri to favor a Kashmiri? If your dear founder was a statesman , he would have been cautious and got Kashmir without doing anything.
5. I have never heard of Pakistan claiming lakshadweep. It may be the most islamic territory in the union. Why so?
6. Sikhs are not Muslims. Yet Pakistan did support them during the 80s. 
7. I feel sorry for you guys. I didnt want to be born here but i am glad i wasnt in that place. That place reminds me of everything about the old india.
8. I was talking about 65 and 71 wars. Both were started by Pakistan. You could perhaps say India fired the formal shots in 65, but in 71 you were the people who started air strikes.  There is a reason, indian liberals have a patronising view of pakistan. Shastri wasnt anti pakistan . Indira was . But for you it was all the same. Because it was ultimately a buffer state to protect us from the russians. Today you guard us from the taliban.
Oh and i mean by formal we fought in internationally recognised borders. You still invaded. If we had opened a front during kargil , you would have perhaps said the same thing.

And lol @ secularism, you guy still pretending to be secular? I thought Modi-Ji put an end to that. 

3. Nope, we claimed Junagadh from the very beginning since it was legally given to us. Unfortunately we had no military at the time and Kashmir also became a thing so we had to prioritize other issues. 
Now that we know we can serve fantastic tea to Indians, we are reminding the world of our legal claim. 

4.  Sheikh Abdullah was a fool, just like Mulana Azad, they have all been proven wrong by the suffering and rape of their people in India. 
Besides, non of that matters. If India can take Junagadh due to Hindu population, then Pakistan can take Kashmir due to Muslim population. 

5. They never acceded to us and their population has never shown interest to join us. We are not Indians, we don't need to prove we don't have small pee pees. Kashmir people do not want to be with India, they want to join Pakistan or be independent.

6. Bangladeshis are not Hindus yet India supported them in 71. The extent Pakistan supported Sikhs was not even 1% of the amount India supported the Bangladeshis in 71. SO once again, India is the source of the problem.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_in_Pakistan#Child%20sexual%20abuse

> Reported cases of child abuse increased by 11 per cent in year 2018 compared to 2017, with more than 10 children suffering some form of abuse every day in Pakistan

Also, this is using available data. The lack of reporting and culture of silence around these issues means that we are looking at the tip of an iceberg of unknown proportion, however that iceberg is greater than the available data.

I don't know where you want to draw the line of 'rampant enough' -- but for me that's pretty 'rampant.'",2,-1,1598903996.0

While this seems to be happening all over the world (lack of adequate parenting), I want to focus on this sentence for a moment, barring geography.

I think parents of today basically have a child because whatever, but they don't have the aptitude to raise a child. They may make money, they may have the luxuries of life, but they lack the brains.

Some are accidental, some are planned - but to raise the child is no easy feat. And I think the permeation of technology and the shift in priorities is mostly to blame - technology itself isn't bad, but being so heavily engrossed in technology, overly reliant on nannies and whatnot is what's PROBABLY leading to this moral breakdown.

Thankfully, not all people are like this. And this video hits home - if there are no people to do the dirty work, then everyone will be living in some filth. The fact that it's stigmatized is insane.

3) Behaviours are our socialization to our environment and social groups, such as families in Pakistan don't teach this kind of behaviour.

So then it begs the question, where do the peers fathom the idea to harass members of society as if it were their birth given right.

h9nyy7h,t1_h9npkeh,"""mera Pakistan esa nahin hai"" is not descriptive, but aspirational.. used to inculcate goodness by sort of excommunicating terrible people and behaviours and actions...

This is similar to how we say to our kids ""mera acha beta khana zaya nahin krta"", chahay us ki adat ho. Or how we say ""real men don't rape"". They are obviously men and obviously rapists. But then we define something good to be part of identity and in order to be a ""real"" man, instead of a pathetic excuse of a man, you respect women. This is because people seem to protect and live by their identity.

I am not advocating for denying the problem. I'm just asking to look at this language from a different angle, and possibly keep using it while also raising awareness. Not in response to such incidents, but maybe when there is something good being shared e.g. something wholesome where people help other people and we say ""this is our Pakistan"".

h9yf1y8,t1_h9y4z03,"Patriarchy is the how societies make men responsible for the weak and vulnerable in a society. Men have to be providers and protectors. Prior to the advent of nation states, the state/ruler was not very involved with people’s day to day lives, men had to be responsible for EVERYTHING. Healthcare, protection, provisioning, safety. This is the only form of assigning social functions that has produced stability in human societies. Look at it this way, with out patriarchy human society could not have been able to organize and bring us where we are today. But the side effect of patriarchy is too much power for the male, and while the women and children are weak and vulnerable, they kind of had to rely on males cz women’s economic utility was very limited prior to the Industrial Age, Islamic patriarchy designs rules which men shall not exceed, effectively limiting the power men can hold. 

Modern day nation states have replaced the functions men used to perform. Better policing, social safety nets, healthcare, providing a robust economy for women can provide for themselves without having to work labor intensive jobs etc. You’d think that is a good thing. Right? And in many senses it is a good thing, but this has allowed individualism to seep into societies. When u don’t rely on men and the community men come together to make up for your access to resources, safety and provisions, u no longer have an incentive to conform to social norms. You are your own person. Your relationship is not with the community anymore. Yo relationship is with the all powerful state. That’s fine and all, but this also deteriorates social cohesion. Because when individuals no longer adhere to the same values and cultural expressions, people no longer identify u as your own. As a result crimes sky rocket. Individualists find it hard to compromise so marriages fail a lot more. More childrenare born out of wedlock and raised in broken homes, which also leads to more crimes. Individualists breed less, so their nation has to import more foreign labor, essentially starting the long process of replacing the host population, because each year, locals will breed less, have less marriages and each year more foreign labor will have to be brought in. People’s morality will be dictated by the state and the family structure will continue to deteriorate.  

In order for the state to continue to fulfill the role males used to fulfill, the state requires strong institutions. Strong institutions need to be well funded. Funding comes from taxes and taxes come from people. But if a society’s population is in a decline, less people pay taxes, hence the need for continued growth of economy and continued import of foreign labor, continued need for burning through this planet’s limited resources. Continued destruction of the oceans, continued deforestation. Continued extractions of the earths resources at increasingly accelerated rates. 

I don’t have to tell you why these things are bad. We are seeing 1st hand how we our destroying our societies and the planet. The patchwork with renewables is slow and in many cases requires us to rape the planet even further. In order to address climate change, we have to dig for expensive natural resources resources that are already in a limited supply. The fast economic growth also means we are using more than our fair share of resources, because we have the buying power to do so. All of these societal and global problems are growing and getting worse partly because progressive nations tried to replace patriarchy.

I don't think we should label opinions as local or foreign. Every opinion should be treated as an opinion, and nothing else.

The problem is when that false opinion becomes an international narrative, and that is where the local media is to blame. Our authors, writer, poets, artists, director, actors, religious personalities need to step and and create work of art, such as films and shows, that can help Pakistan create a narrative before India paints a picture for the world.

We need to tell our own stories.

Why are Indians making movies before us, especially on topics like Mughal History, Mohenjo Daro, Ghalib, etc etc. Why haven't we made a single piece of electronic media on our own version of the story and presented it to the world.

When you live in a country where things are running much better than they are in Pakistan, you gain a new perspective.

You realize that there are better ways of doing things and of thinking about things.

You become frustrated as you see all the things Pakistan continues to do horribly wrong.

Where is the Land reform? Every country that grew economically did land reforms.

What's up with the education system? A literate and educated population is a must to be competitive.

What kind of country excommunicates an entire sect in their constitution? Nobody does that.

What kind of country fires an economics adviser because Mullahs who don't know the first thing about economics demanded his resignation? This was an international embarrassment.

There are plenty of other Muslim countries. But in those countries, the mullahs don't determine government policy and the government keeps control of them. Extremist clerics are dealt with; not allowed to fester like Pakistan.

We prioritize religion to the point of toxicity. Imran Khan claims to understand the West but he compares Holocaust denial to the prophet being insulted. He embarrassed us on a global stage by saying this stuff.

And finally, democracy doesn't work when your population is illiterate and uneducated.  You need a leader with the actual authority to push through much needed reforms if you want your country to develop. When you are a developing country like Pakistan, you cannot fire a world-class economics adviser because illiterates on the street are demanding it.

So local Pakistanis, understand one thing. When we overseas Pakistanis tell you that Pakistan is a shithole that can do 100x better, that is because we have experienced both Pakistan and other countries. We know that there exists better ways to do things. We love Pakistan and so we want it to be better.

Don't get so offended and maybe listen to what we say. This country is decades behind others and will never catch up if it remains so closed-minded and bigoted.

h9dv9l8,t3_p6a0ag,"I don't doubt the intentions of oversees Pakistanis, but here are a few issues I have found with them:

1. They are not aware of the ground realities of Pakistan and think that their life experiences apply to Pakistan and Pakistanis. A small example of this I saw on this subreddit a while ago was where someone was recommending not buying a car because they lose value as soon and they drive off the lot. Which is true for the west but the reality is the exact opposite in Pakistan.

2. They only hear the rosy promises made by the politicians and do not have to live with the consequences. They fundamentally have a lot less at stake politically and economically than someone whose life is in Pakistan and many of them do not respect that fact.

3. They do not assimilate into the societies they are a part of and look down on them. ""Gorey ghaleez hotey hein"", ""goron ko rishton ki tameez nahi hoti"" etc are things we have all heard. They live in silos and look down on their host countries while also continuing to live there which is just hypocritical and hurts the image of the entire country.

4. They think sending remittance gives them a direct say in the country's politics. Which makes little sense because if the country was doing bad economically they would be the group that would benefit the most from it because of exchange rates. Again, remittance is great for the economy and a necessity even, but it is not sent for the good of the country. That is a welcomed side effect of it.

5. Realted to all of the above, they are in an identity crisis where they are not willing to accept their adopted countries as their own even if they were born there but are also ignorant about life in Pakistan. Which leads to an overt display of patriotism that results in more problems and ignorant opinions that those living in Pakistan find laughable and sometimes offensive.

6. Also, minior grievance, they keep investing in property instead of businesses and drive the cost of land up for the local population which actually needs the land to make homes.

They weren't specifically targeting army associated people (it wasn't a separation thing), any Punjabi was fair game i.e. doctors, teachers etc. Coupled with that the backward ugly mindset of feudal/tribal leaders of even picking up random women from street for their pleasure, my grandfather even stopped girls of the family from going outside the home during that time.

Because of the deteriorating situation in Baluchistan, I don't recall clearly but I think it was the governor of Punjab who offered govt jobs to punjabi people back home. So most of the Punjabis moved back selling out their houses etc at below market rates to just get the hell out.

I've been told this story since childhood, this is why I find it funny when I see posts that central govt is responsible for backwardness in Baluchistan.

Now this is happening in a country where they prides themselves on ""freedom of speech and women's rights"". If you want to see a model of a country that has a similar culture but implemented feminism and secularism, look at India. I'm sure you're aware of their track record of women's rights and protection, especially lower income women. Islam already has human rights guidelines. If a bunch of Lahori kanjar insaan decide to catcall and harass a woman walking by, it's our job to make sure they are punished for their behavior and they understand what Islam says about this behavior not man if only feminism was Pakistan, this wouldn't happen.",5,0,1629281936.0

When I said we all love Immy, I meant he isn't a chor daku, we want more people like him in. People like Sania Nishtar, Dr Moeed Yousuf, Tania Aidrus etc who all have that foreign experience that bring something valuable to the country. That's not to say the locals are stupid, that'd be extremely demeaning to my father, and my forefathers who fought hard to free Pakistan and Kashmir (some of my family hails from Chitral, have served the military for generations, including my father).

Edit: I was voicing my frustration due to all the corruption. Good people, regardless of being local or foreign, have been driven away or killed, I've experienced this personally, it makes you world weary. The ones that stay and live are hardcore, though they're always in danger, some good local friends of mine included. I'm one of the lucky ones that knows people who can protect us and keep us safe, relatively speaking. But I shouldn't have to, I shouldn't have to live in a gated community to feel safe. It's not fair on the average folk, who aren't as fortunate or privileged as I may be. 

So please don't entertain the fact that I'm some foreign snowflake, whose never been in a dangerous situation before, I take it personally because you don't know me or my life story. Tis not good to pass on stereotypes and caricatures.",6,2,1629287895.0

India implemented feminism. Lol, what are you smoking bro. They did have a secular govt. and turning out much worse now that they're shifting to hindu nationalism.

I'm not saying Islam doesn't have these guidelines. I'm saying conservatives and religious elements have been resisting any improvements in improving women's  rights or minorities rights, or even breaking up feudalism in Pakistan.

If you have these feelings that the west is full or problems and Islam has all the solutions, by all means come back to Pakistan. But you won't because the institutions and the money they offer trumps any attachment to Islam you might have.

We often see people bringing up overseas Pakistanis in an attempt to somehow segregate them from locals,  but please explain how this is an improvement? There's already a flair, but to me it seems like a 'divide and conquer' kind of thing. It's creating a separation where it need not be. 

Pakistan is not a static environment where the traditions and customs are in some type of sandbox. Pakistani culture is changing so fast that anything you may call a tradition can be challenged. Fight back by maintaining your own customs for as long as you can,  but don't fool yourself by thinking Pakistan is not just changing, but has already changed drastically. Its not good or bad,  it just is. And so I don't think local opinions are any more valid or valuable unless you can show how overseas interference is causing a disruption or degradation of the discussion. 

So if you can,  please explain what the reddit community gains by having a higher proportion of locals.

Put 2 and 2 together (along with even a general understanding of the Quran) and it's easy to conclude that no, there is supposed to be no punishment for blasphemy alone. All punishments for ""blasphemy"" during the Prophet's time involved characters that involved in other heinous crimes against Muslims.

hnlusd2,t1_hn4fz4t,"Agree. Majority of terrorism is associated with Islam whether it's real or not. I'm a Sri Lankan and 2019 Muslim extremists killed over 250 people here by bombing. They attacked Catholics and foreigners. They had plans to attack us, Buddhists too. They thought they would go to heaven by doing that. I don't know if I'm wrong, but my Muslim friend said in the Quran its stated that non believers were killed in a certain war in the past. But these people misinterpreted as it's a good thing to kill non muslims now too. 

I mean in Buddhism harming other's is never justified. It's a sin to intentionally harm another even as a self defence. There is not a word in Buddhist scripts that can be misinterpreted as harming others is ever okay. Not like quran. 
Of course, in today's world there are people who identify as buddists harm others too. They do it because of their own mentality. The religion has nothing to do with it. They don't think they would go to heaven and have all these virgins. 

When they interviewed one of the suicide bombers' family, they said their son became more religious close to the attack. My friend's dad who is also a Muslim he get criticised from his family for not being so religious when he is one of the good people I've ever met. If there's a heaven, he is the one to go there. So from these two cases what I understood was if you know a Muslim who started to become more and more religious you should definitely stay away from them.

>why would pakistan be a muslim country not like it was muslims that live there

So, is turkey a muslim country? It is muslim majority and calls itself secular. Is it or is it not an ""islamic"" country like pakistan?


>not like islam that showed us how to maintain our societies and the best things for them.

Pretty sure we have a constitution that is written in english and most laws are copied from the british empire.

Also, we got ""democracy"" from the british/west. And we wear pant shirt (western clothes), even your railway tracks were made by the british.


>Plus most muslims didnt leave to go to foreign lands for islam we all know why the majority left it was for money the west had a high valued currency and cushy lives

Yes, how dare they de restsire for their families to live a better life in a foreign land, they should like us in our own land. 


>pakistanis that left saw the kaafir nations as being better then an islamic one

I mean... They are better than most ""islamic nations"".

Let's just compare pakistan with norway. 



Pakistan

People die of hunger. 

Women are discouraged from holding jobs.

Corruption and bribery is rampant.

People get killed for saying anything wrong by a mob.

Terrorism is high.

Food mixed with chemicals


Norway

People do not die of hunger, government usually has social programs for the poor.

Women are encouraged to hold old jobs.

Corruption and bribery is not rampant

People don't get killed for saying anything wrong by a mob.

Terrorism is almost non-existent.

Food is clean and is not mixed with any chemicals.


>its better to die as a muslim in a poor country then a muslim chasing earthly desires

Some Muslims chase earthly desires in every country they live in, others don't chase earthly desires no matter which country they live in.

It has nothing to do with the country. What, now i can't go to norway because my faith is so weak that once i see alcohol and women, i will become alcoholic and rapist? Stop believing the people around you and think!


>we have our own islamic nations and we should try to fix muslims problems

Best way to fix those problems is either 

-become the prime minister and try and fail like IK

Which you can't even try in your most ""islamic"" country Saudi Arabia.

-or leave the country learn about islam and teach it to muslims and non-muslims alike.

It isn't an average muslim's duty to fix islamic nations.

Average muslims duty is to god and god tells people to  teach islam and do good.


Muslim empire was destroyed in the 13th century. Ottoman empire was destroyed in 20th century. 
Empires/countries come and go but islam remains.

And that is what matters.

>not like most the people in this group who dont even understand the problems they caused for their children and probably never will.

Because of the problems they understood, they left. People die/ get oppressed/ forced to pay bribes. Much more frequently in pakistan than in norway.

It is completely understandable if they want to leave.



P.S 
I am muslim myself.
 ""Islam is perfect but muslims are not"" 
Calling anything islamic doesn't make it one. 

Islamic society is one where islam is followed most closely. And people desire to move to that society.

A country like norway may not call itself islamic but it is more closer to an islamic society than pakistan is.

Most illegal things are also sins for muslims.

And norway is more successful in most of them than most islamic nations.

Killing, raping, molesting, bribing, corruption, care for people who are addicted to drugs and need help, suicide, etc etc ... Etc

All you hear is they have alochol, lgbtq, sex before marriage, women wearing few clothes.

But have you ever thought that maybe none of that matters if your faith is strong. 

Nobody forces you to drink alcohol, become gay, have sex before marriage, wear bikini and go beaches as women.

A blind man had a slave-mother who used to abuse the Prophet (ﷺ) and disparage him. He forbade her but she did not stop. He rebuked her but she did not give up her habit. One night she began to slander the Prophet (ﷺ) and abuse him. So he took a dagger, placed it on her belly, pressed it, and killed her. A child who came between her legs was smeared with the blood that was there. When the morning came, the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed about it.

He assembled the people and said: I adjure by Allah the man who has done this action and I adjure him by my right to him that he should stand up. Jumping over the necks of the people and trembling the man stood up.

He sat before the Prophet (ﷺ) and said: Messenger of Allah! I am her master; she used to abuse you and disparage you. I forbade her, but she did not stop, and I rebuked her, but she did not abandon her habit. I have two sons like pearls from her, and she was my companion. Last night she began to abuse and disparage you. So I took a dagger, put it on her belly and pressed it till I killed her.

Thereupon the Prophet (ﷺ) said: Oh be witness, no retaliation is payable for her blood.""

Both are religious and historical texts.  The Quran was transmitted by the companions of the Prophet pbuh, same as the Hadiths. They both are important, though to us Muslims the Quran holds more weight.

>Blind faith on the work of scholars 1000 years ago.

It's not blind faith. There is literally a topic called the ""Science of Hadith"". The scholars of the past did most of our works for us. Imam Bukhari and Imam Muslim scrutinised any and all narrations, and they had a very detailed process of whether they wanted to include a Hadith in their collection. That is why Hadiths from Sahih Bukhari and Sahih Muslim are considered authentic to the highest level by all scholars because of their rigorous process. Any Hadith which had even the slightest of doubt was not included in their collections.

The scholars of the past were highly intellectual, even more than the scholarship we have today.They documented everything. That is why their works are still referenced today, and FYI, they are scrutinised and re-evaluation by Islamic scholarship. You can simply talk to an Islamic scholar with a degree in Islamic studies, and they will inform you.

If you ask any sane scholar of Islam, they will explain to you the context of those hadiths,  there's a level of politics involved as well. People who appostated during those times, did so with the intention of treason or to encourage apostasy, all with the intention to harm the Islamic State. In that context, why shouldn't the punishment of treason be death? The punishment for treason in every country today is death.

I would encourage you to look into the Science of Hadiths. It seems you are a bit out of touch with how Islamic scholarship is actually being conducted.

In my view, the problem is that people are uneducated and listen to ""scholars"" who have absolutely no credentials, who take these Hadiths / Quranic text out of context to fit their agenda.

The solution to which in my view would be to formalize Islamic scholarship in Pakistan i.e. you cannot preach/teach islam without having the proper credentials",5,1,1638613848.0

Religious understanding needs a huge overhaul in Pakistan. Sh Albani is considered a mujaddid of our times precisely bcos he brought up the fact that the only infallible 'document' we have is the Quran.... everything else can be scrutinized by those with proper education on the matter. Sahih Bukhari is an amazing body of literature and along with the Quran it makes up so much of how we practice our deen on a day to day basis... the technicalities etc, but it *can* have mistakes. It is not a divine work. Hadith relating to historical events, with no relation to the practice of the faith, should be looked at twice, thrice, even more.

Deobandis, Barelvis and Salafis have one thing in common; they decide who/what has infallibility. For the Salafis it's Ibn Taymiyya, Bukhari and Abdul Wahhab.  For the Barelvis/Deobandis it's all their ""babas"". At the end of the day both groups have their own little personlity-worship cult and it's scary af.

Before I get started, I wanna be fully clear that I'm exmuslim too and for good reason. You're right that Islam does not call for the killing of innocents. Except in Islam's eyes, apostates are not innocent. Furthermore, there's a sahih hadith that shows Muhammad condemning vigilante justice when it came to blasphemy that sets the precedent. All that really says is if that man really did commit blasphemy and really did rip off posters with malicious intent, that the mob lynching him and killing him would be justified. Are you seriously okay with that?

One night she began to slander the Prophet (ﷺ) and abuse him. So he took a dagger, placed it on her belly, pressed it, and killed her. A child who came between her legs was smeared with the blood that was there. When the morning came, the Prophet (ﷺ) was informed about it.

He wasn't interested in arguing the merit of the quotes based on substance. So he collected whatever he could, even narrations which contradict each other.

Nisai was a quote aggregator. He had two sides, a collector side and a scholarly side. He curated based on tranmission merit, but also argued merit based on substance. But sides were kept separate, as was the tradition of the time. He was very gung-ho though, and got stoned by a mob for openly cursing the Ummayad dynasty. So if you'd ask him, he wouldn't consider these narrations to have merit as well. 

History is fun when you realize different people have different perspectives of an event. But it can get dangerous when people take narrations as canon and misuse them. I will give you an example:

The first narration you mentioned is by Ikramah right. Ikramah, along with Ibn Abi Sarh, was one of the only 10 people ordered to be killed during at the [conquest of Mecca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conquest_of_Mecca#Aftermath). Him and Sarh ends up participating the murder of Uthman, and then Ikramah makes claim about Ali burning apostates now this narration is used by extremists.

Now according to sources, either 2, 1, or 0 out of 10 people end up actually be killed after the conquest of Mecca. Stark contrast, but it just shows that people like Nisai and Bukhari did their job. They didn't make the decision for us to gauge history. They collected everything and left it for people to decide what happened. We have narrations about each one of the people. 

One of the narration states that a singing girl of Al-Maqis was killed who incited war against Medina. Another narration states that after the battle of Badr, people stopped listening to this girl, so she traveled to Medina to ask for monetary help from Muhammad. Muhammad asked him if business was bad, and she said that the loss of Badr and death of Abu Lahb had dried up all streams. So he ordered people to collect grain for her. She collected it and took it back to Makkah where she continued her profession. Ibn Hisham states this and he takes it from Ibn Ishaq, who took it from Aban. But Nisai argues, that there is no way these two statements go together. 

Anyways this is getting long. Point is, history often has multiple sides. We don't have verified single source of information about the events back then. We have multiple. So we can't use it as canon.",7,2,1638857571.0

I asked for proof with regards to ""Islam allows killing innocent non-muslims or apostates"" because this is a non-sense claim, and no true muslim believes in this non-sense.

With regards to Blasphemy (which is different from apostasy).

In an Islamic state, you are not allowed publicly mock Islam and disrespect Prophet PBUH. Public provocation in the lands of Islam is not allowed. That in Islamic Law is what is considered Blasphemy, if you intentionally publicly verbally abuse the Prophet PBUH or anything against Islam.

One of the purpose of an Islamic state is that the society is not indulging in things which are considered immoral in Islam, for that reason in Islamic Law does not believe in absolute free speech, where you are able to publicly verbally abuse things that people hold dear to themselves, regardless of who you are (Muslim/Non-Muslim) A muslim insulting a Christian or a Jew would also not be allowed.

  


With regards to the punishment, There is a difference if provocation comes from a Muslim vs a non-muslim but in general, whoever commits public deliberate Blasphemy has to be tried by the authorities and the court system, to determine the details of the case (Is he mentally ok? Does he know what he is saying etc.).

He is of course then able to defend himself. If the conclusion of the court is that it was intentional deliberate provocation knowing the consequences, then the majority position of scholars is that punishment for that is indeed execution.

Some scholars (Hanafi) scholars deem this punishment for Muslims only, for Non-Muslims living in an Islamic state, they are to be punished but not killed.

>What about punishments less harsher than death?

With regards to the extent of the punishment, It's all dependent on our moral systems. In Islamic law, public verbal abuse against Islam and the Prophet PBUH is extremely immoral, which might not be the case for you.

Incest is considered immoral and illegal in many places, even western societies, and the punishment for Incest is ""Punishable by five years' to life imprisonment,""

To someone who believes there is nothing wrong with Incest, these laws may be too extreme. So whose morals systems are we suppose to follow? Yours? Western Secular morals? Or the guy who thinks Incest is good? You see the problem with using your morality to judge others? What you deem right and wrong is not necessarily what the other person thinks is right and wrong.

In a democracy, the moral system of a country is dependent on what the majority deem moral and immoral. In an Islamic state, the moral system is dependent on what God has deemed moral and immoral based on scripture.",7,7,1638621254.0

hn6rt7f,t1_hn6im17,"First of all, I am thankful that you are staying respectful. As you can imagine, a lot of ex-muslims straight out hate on Islam.

>So are you denying that Islam calls for the killing of apostates then?

Yes Indeed, I am denying this. The Quran is actually against apostasy.

""Allah will neither forgive nor show the right way to those who believed, and then disbelieved, then believed, and again disbelieved, and thenceforth became ever more intense in their disbelief."" Quran 4:137

If punishment of apostasy was death, it would be impossible to believe again after disbelief, as they would have been put to death after the first disbelief. You will perhaps find Hadiths about Apostasy, but you should be careful and very importantly read their contexts. Apostasy during that time meant more than just ""I dont believe in Islam"", it was done for intention of harming the Islamic state (treason). Religion and politics during that time were intertwined, so if someone became an apostate, they did so to side with the enemy of the state. Treason as far as I know is punishable by death in almost all countries.

Now to address the Hadith (Sunan Abi Dawud 4361) with regards to Blasphemy.

This story is indicative of the justice with which the Muslims dealt with the people of the Book. The rights of the Jews who had entered into a treaty with the Muslims were guaranteed and protected, and it was not permissible to transgress against them by annoying them or harming them in any way. Hence when the people found a Jewish woman who had been slain, they were upset and they referred the matter to the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), who had given them that covenant and promise of safety, and had not taken the jizyah from them. He got angry and adjured the Muslims by Allaah that the one who had done this deed should show himself, so that he might determine his punishment and issue a ruling concerning him. But when he found out that she had broken the covenant time after time, by insulting the Messenger of Allaah (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) and reviling him, all her rights were denied, and she deserved the punishment of execution which Shariah imposes on everyone who reviles the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him), whether he is a Muslim or a dhimmi  because transgressing against the status of the Prophets is disbelief in Allah, and it invalidates every sanctity, right and covenant/contract; it is a major betrayal to the Islamic state, because they would be in clear violation of the contract.

In an Islamic state, you are not allowed publicly mock Islam and disrespect Prophet PBUH. Public provocation in the lands of Islam is not allowed. That in Islamic Law is what is considered Blasphemy, if you intentionally publicly verbally abuse the Prophet PBUH or anything against Islam.  There is of course difference between verbally abusing / deliberate provocation compared to having a discussion. One of the purpose of an Islamic state is indeed that the society is not indulging in things which are considered immoral in Islam, for that reason in Islamic Law does not believe in absolute free speech, where you are able to publicly verbally abuse things that people hold dear to themselves, regardless of who you are.

With regards to the punishment. There is a difference if provocation comes from a Muslim vs a non-muslim but in general, whoever commits public deliberate Blasphemy has to be tried by the authorities and the court system, to determine the details of the case (Is he mentally ok? Does he know what he is saying etc.).He is of course then able to defend himself. If the conclusion of the court is that it was intentional deliberate provocation knowing the consequences, then the  majority position of scholars is that punishment for that is indeed execution.

Some scholars (Hanafi) scholars deem this punishment for Muslims only, for Non-Muslims living in an Islamic state, they are to be punished but not killed.

I encourage you, whatever your reasons were that you be more fair in your research, and see if there is an explanation for these Hadiths from ***actual*** scholars. It's not enough for you to read these Hadiths and take them out of context. There was no difference between religion and politics during that time, so it was always the case, that if someone left Islam, they did so with the intention to harm the Muslims (Which is documented)

>Spare the treason line, heard it before and it doesn't make it better. You guys seriously don't realize that it makes an Islamic state actually existing look way worse rather than way better.

Scholars differentiate between **major** & **minor** apostasy. Hadiths need to be contextualised. The key difference between the two is treason or helping enemies attack Muslims. During the time of the Prophet PBUH, not a single person was killed for leaving Islam. Neither of which are punishable by death  
p.s. When AbdAllah ibn Sa'd ibn Abi'l Sarh (Uthman's bosom brother) apostated - and after having been Muslim and scribe of the Prophet pbuh - he went to the enemy side and conducted a media war against the Muslims (he was a poet, poetry was how information was spread). When he was vulnerable, Uthman ibn Affan interceded and and offered him protection. The Prophet pbuh accepted it and pardoned him (he later became Muslim again). See [Dr. Jonathan Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp9K3qlcE4I)'s take on the issue  
p.p.s. Interestingly, it was the pagans who first accused the Muslims of being apostates.  


>Correct! So you agree that in the end in the end the man was let go and rebuked for vigilantism because he killed someone for blasphemy. So in this case, the men that killed this man, Priyantha Diyawadana, would have been in the right only if he had actually maliciously ripped apart posters or verbally abused Muhammad. You're okay with them lynching him like this if he really had did those things?

The Hadith that was quoted was one time scenario, does not entail at all that people should take law into their own hands. You will not find a single Islamic scholar which would agree with you with regards to this

No what happened in Sialkot was disgusting (Since I've heard he only took down TTP poster) the people taking law in their hands should never be done, it is not allowed in Islam. Blasphemy law is to only be applied as far as I know if someone verbally abuses Islam and/or the Prophet PBUH  with the intention of driving people away from Islam, and with the intention to divide the society in an Islamic society- and this has to be carried out by court to determine if the person truly is guilty of doing this and scholars have in many cases allowed  Blasphemer a chance to reflect on ones mistake and take the said words back (as demonstrated by cases in history, whenever this happened) - and yes it is then justified in an Islamic state, if the person was found guilty. If you view this to be wrong, then we're simply talking about morals. Why are your morals more human than Islamic morals? Who decide what is more right or more wrong?",9,1,1638636819.0

hn7gefg,t1_hn6ksyn,"Considering that many exmuslim arguments do look at what other scholars say for example in tafsirs to back up their arguments, no. Islamic scholars, of the past at least, do understand Islam and a lot of their views are in line with exmuslims too.

As for Muslims in general, I don't think everyone is naive but it's fair to say not everyone truly understands Islam or has looked into it as much as some exmuslims have.",9,1,1638633849.0

TLDR: There is a distinction  
\- **Minor apostasy** is when someone embraces Islam and later leaves the religion peacefully without causing harm to the community. The sin is purely between the apostate and his Lord, and worldly punishments are not applied in this case.

**- Major apostasy** is when a person embraces Islam and later leaves the religion while combining this with the political crime of treason. Legal punishment against such persons can only be carried out by a lawful authority according to due process, and it is not permissible for individual Muslims to carry out this punishment on their own.

No, I am not saying Tianemen Square was ok.  We all know that the millions who died in Partition it was not justified.  Tianemen was also a type of Partition.  The 80's in China was a revolution.  

I highly recommend checking out Reddits favorite documentary guy Adam Curtis. He has some new series which shows the interviews of the leaders and followers of Tianemen and offers some real insights.

These are very complicated events.  If you or I were in charge or part of the protest I do not know what we would do different without hindsight.

Morning came no Dr came to see me and was told the Dr had left at 12pm midday. I decided to check out but before I did I asked for the PR office and was told to wait 5 mins and would be called inside. When I went inside, the PR officer was a Army Colonel. I sat down and explained my disappointment with what had happened to me while here ( not expecting anything). He picked up the phone and called the Ward I stayed in and asked for the Dr on duty. Both Drs where not available and had left. He was angry, apologized and was embarrassed at what had happened. He thanked me for raising this issue because he said most people rant and rave then leave and the right people are not informed. We had a pleasant discussion but agreed it is unacceptable.My total bill was 23,000rs ( medicine and drip charges included) he asked for my bill and removed the amount of 17,000rs( some tax added) and I only paid 6,000rs for my medicine I had purchased and the drip. My whole point is that sometimes ranting and arguing with these people is not the way. Maybe there is a correct procedure to follow ( maybe not) but you need to try and speak to the right people only then you will get the right answers.

2. No or poor understanding of Inflation. I have relatives who gloat about how X plot has risen Y amount. Yet a simple calculation shows theres nothing to gloat about. Its all in their heads.

3. They want to avoid tax. So benefit fraud is a real thing (dont @ me with the UK stereotypes) and I see most people who get hooked on that stuff unwillingly to let go. The result is they have to hide the money and ergo do so in Pakistan. Its so obnoxious you have benefit claimants here go back home to these lavish “Kotis” and laud it over the people back there yet the reality is very different.

As most people know, he's in jail and he was a disgrace to pakistan, unfortunately, details of that deal weren't released to the public much at all, and in such a gigantic trade deal that makes China and Pakistan undoubtable allies, its impossible for future governments to oppose China, and Pakistan needs them for their survival because economically, Pakistan is in shambles after the huge corruption by previous governments, and struggles to pay back debts and have any sort of well-functioning welfare system because of this. If China withdrew support now, because Pakistan opposed them, the consequences would be catastrophic. Pakistan would slowly descend into an economic collapse as all of the investments in places such as Gwadar and all the infrastructure would come to a halt, and the loans China has given to Pakistan will probably be demanded back, and Pakistan would be left to collapse. It was a deal done by nawaaz sharif, that was probably not as good for Pakistan as it couldve been and probably shouldnt have even happened if he, or other corrupt runners, weren't in power.

For that matter, where does it say that you should even kill anyone who disrespects the Prophet? Kuffaar physically abused the prophet and he forgave most, if not all, during Fatah Makkah.

This is radicalisation whose cure is certainly not polarisation. Radicalisation essentially started with loss of law and order in middle eastern countries. Which was caused by wars waged by European countries. Enmity and polarisation leads to radicalisation of the oppressed i.e. the colonised, invaded and war torn countries. The solution was deep assistance and aid to the countries the Europeans destroyed. Leaving and maligning them led to enmity. A need for revenge on the ones who destroyed. And they came up with brainwashing their people through religion, which has been done even in Europe throughout history when they waged holy wars, and caused a massive uprising and radicalisation of many a people. The solution now is still the same. Reduce enmity, provocation, de-radicalise and fight the extremist mindset through education and help.

gam23ds,t1_galtyg6,"I interact with a lot of Pakistanis here in the US. Unfortunately, a lot of them belong to my own extended family. 

Pakistanis, and I assume, other muslims from similar background countries have a dual problem. They have an inferiority complex when it comes to the white man. But also a superiority complex when it comes to non-white people, especially blacks, Indians and Hispanics. We also have a terrible understanding of all of these demographic groups. The white man is this perfect species that can do no wrong. And for some reason, there is this weird idea that every white person is a devout christian, and is super into religion. This is NOT true, especially in bigger states like NY and California. Hardly anyone even visits church anymore and most people are strongly secular, preferring not to discuss religion with others. 

The admiration for the white man is accompanied with an equal amount of contempt for Indians. I can't believe how much hatred expat Pakistanis have for Indians. Even though they are community most similar to us, and having a lot of common issues and goals. It is actually just a veil for jealousy though. Most indians are very well to do, working in high paying jobs such as software and doctors. They have homes most Pakistanis can only dream of owning. So the automatic assumption is that they must have ""cheated"" their way to success. Fun fact though, almost every pakistani who works in the motel or gas station business cheats on their taxes here. They hide cash income, so that they can get government benefits, as well as lowering their tax income. The rationale is ""we are poor hard working immigrants, and we deserve to keep our money"", even if they have been their for 2p years and own 5 gas stations.

The solution was deep assistance and aid to the countries the Europeans destroyed. Leaving and maligning them led to enmity. A need for revenge on the ones who destroyed. And they came up with brainwashing their people through religion, which has been done even in Europe throughout history when they waged holy wars, and caused a massive uprising and radicalisation of many a people.

The verse directly before says:

However, after having covered a certain distance on their way to Makkah, they awoke to their folly. When they thought of marching back to Madinah, Allah Almighty filled their hearts with such awe and fear that they could not muster the courage to do so**. The most they could do was to hire a Madinah-bound villager to go there and tell Muslims that theu were coming back. But, this whole deal came into the knowledge of the oly Prophet (p) in Madinah through revelation. He marched to Hamra al-Asad to apprehend them but they had already run away from there. This was the background in which the present verse was revealed.”

First one

**2:190** **Fight in the way of Godthose who fight you but do not transgress. Indeed. God does not like transgressors.**  
**2:191 And kill them wherever you find them and** **expel them from wherever they have expelled you,** **and fitnah \[Persecution\] is worse than killing.

**2:193** **Fight them until there is no \[more\] fitnah \[Persecution\]** **and \[until\] worship is for God. But if they cease, then there is to be no aggression except against the oppressors.**

Why do you think its only waderas. The last couple cases happened in Karachi. Living in Karachi, I dont think there are many waderas here. 

>The national government is pro minorities, whether you like or not.

The national government hasnt done much in anyway to be called pro-minority. Maybe in their heart they are. But action matters. You cant just change things with good will. Why is it that Ahmedis have to be humiliated by forcing the muslims to call Mirza Ghulam Ahmed a liar. Why is there more outrage from IK on the France end when the minorities in this country are suffering. And he is silent. He can actually do something about the minorities in Pak, instead he is writing love letters to Zuck and OIC. If I was a minority I wouldnt care as much about a temple or whether foreigners can visit their shrines in Pakistan. I would however care that nobody is calling my prophet a liar and that my daughters arent being kidnapped and raped while the judges get fat from bribes.


> Maybe we should be like France, if you see a woman in an abaya then the police should be allowed to put a gun to her head and strip her naked for muh republic.

No you are right, We should remain as we are. Where children get kidnapped and raped by men more then 3 times their age while the judges rule in favor of the rapist. Its almost like there is a middle road between the two cases. Which is where we should strive to be. But whenever anyone gives justified criticism, people like you show up acting like all is good in Pakistan because muh katarpur.

Only a dumbass or someone looking to malign Islam would take that out of context. If you read the actual surah and not just a a specific line, you'd understand. But I forget, the entirety of your knowledge consists of the sentence ""Islam bad"" and a couple of misinformed posts on an Islamophobic sub or website.

>On top of that, I would need to have been brainwashed as a child as well for me to be an apostate. Luckily for me my parents didn't abuse me like that.
Basically you're saying that you're not gonna look into the thing you're condemning? Pretty bleak mindset you got there. It would be at least worth debating if you even had the slightest knowledge on anything you're talking about. 

>Luckily for me my parents didn't abuse me like that.
Unfortunately, your parents haven't seemed to have guided you in the slightest and have left you to find everything on your own. And instead of making educated decisions and condemnations, you decided, ""oh hey! I read islam bad, so islam bad!""

Again. As I said. Its not just Sindh. Things like that happen in Punjab aswell. Theres also the bachabazi culture (which is not against minority but its still abuse) in KPK. Theres the tribal laws in Balochistan (which are hell for the women there) aswell. No province in Pakistan is free from absolute savagery.

> Hardly the case that this government is hell bent on hurting religious sentiments of minorities.

As I have said. I dont think that this government is against minorities. I mean there are MNA members from PTI like Ali Muhammad Khan and Noorul Haq Qadri, who have made it their lifes mission to demonise Ahmedis. But I do agree that IK, Asad, Fawad and Shireen Mazari atleast care about minority rights. But as I said. They are in power now. They could have tried to force their way through. In Pakistan oppositions have always tried to make life hell for the sitting govt. IK did it too. Which is his right. But does that mean that you fold your arms and start acting impotent whenever you meet resistance.


> It feels like you think we should just stay silent when our religion is attacked or when muslims are unfairly targeted.

I didnt say that. Tell me where I said that. I just said that you shouldnt press the 'X' button whenever you face justified criticism. We live in Pakistan, we are responsible for protecting minorities. But IK recently has been going all out with his letters. Did he comment on the Arzoo case. Has he done anything for Ahmedi rights since he has been in office. I mean he can say all he wants about how muslim sentiments are hurt. And thats ok, cuz muslims do have a right to feel hurt. But what about the hurt sentiments of Ahmedis when people call their prophet fake or liar. IK is the only one who can do something about that. The fact that he would rather care about foreign issues rather than solving issues back home just shows that he doesnt care as much as he would like us to think.


The last couple laws that were passed by the govt had to do with adding khatam-e-nabuwat after Prophets name and not drawing prophets caricatures. Tell me which dumbass in Pakistan is brave enough to draw a caricature. Tell me is that what the govt should be prioritizing. Obviously no.

If you prioritize other nations on top of mine than GTFO of my country, that is if you even live in my country lmao.

Oh wow I'm so shocked you look at Pakistani problems through the lens of your white masters, i wonder why i don't want people like you commenting on things you don't know jack shit about?

When have i hated a minority group? How am i fascist? Seems to me you just hate people who love Pakistanis. Maybe you are the real fascist? No nation can exist without nationalism, especially not Pakistan, nationalism is supporting your country over others, that's it",8,1,1604042196.0

Nope. These reports are based of reported no of violence cases against minorities.  There's a section on violence against minorities in their yearly security reports.(https://www.pakpips.com/) You get to hear a lot about Sindh because there are people who speak in support of minorities(mostly Sindhi Hindus) whenever something like that happens, due to Sindhi nationalism. Just look at the famous Reena and Raveena's case, [they were popularised as forced conversions and it turned out they weren't forced.](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2235763/1-hindu-sisters-married-muslim-men-reconcile-families).",8,2,1604039439.0

I dont mind people putting NSFW tag for it, i can just scroll past it without seeing it. That is the acceptable way of doing it. Like you can see in this video the boy is dying and i might not have a stomach for such content but it wasnt taged NSFW. I worry because i have younger siblings who use internet and who watch TV. These things are not suitable for kids no matter the outcome. They are not suitable for some adult people too.


I appreciate you taking the time to respond, money might be a factor for some. In this video you can hear the cameraman saying the doctors name and how she saved the boys life. The  doctor is appreciated and will definitely should be appreciated but saying her name out loud at the end made me question the intention of the person taking the video. It felt like self promotion. Not that i mind if it was because a boy was saved but in doing so you made me watch a video which i have no stomach for.

Yes, but can u implement it? No, you have no position in the government.

that's not saying there aren't PTI cultist there most certainly are braindead PTI supporters i.e. the lot who have accepted IK as their Peer-o-Murshid  


but they are a minority. I literally know people who have been to PTI rallies and got even tear gassed but would still cuss and swear at IK and say the only reason for their support is because he is the least foul individuals among the pile of shit that we call pakistan's political class",3,10,1680985022.0
jfhsmr9,t1_jfh0l2w,"> They almost left him.

That does not equate to holding it accountable. Would you still consider it accountability if IK had left the panama troupe alone after it was leaked and hoped they somehow convict themselves? If your answer is ""No"", how can leaving PTI on its own fix the mistakes by the party itself then? 

The point is that this is a lazy man's approach which is not very effective. Just look at the situation now, all those people who got enraged over IK's choice of coalitions and vowed to not vote for PTI, their ""input"" doesn't hold any ground now, does it? PTI is going into the next election with the likes of Elahi et al. and these very supporters will have to vote questionable people just to get IK back in power because other parties are worse. So basically, the lazy approach is filling PTI with the similar set of people as other parties, to the point where if IK is no more, PTI is the same as other parties, and internally elects someone with a weak morality, and guess what, we are back to square one where not a single party is worth voting for.

TL;DR: Don't leave your support to PTI if you are frustrated. Instead get answers from IK the way IK moved his a$$ and got answers out of the panama guys.",3,6,1680989016.0

Hasan Ali definitely should have caught the ball and maybe the result could have changed but I feel our bowling in the middle and death overs was average and that made us lose the match.  He's not the only one to blame. Also we were atleast 15 runs short I believe. 

Babar and Rizwan give good starts but I feel the rest of the batsmen dont capitalize the good opening start. Our openers have been saving us. Fakhar is good for odi/Tests but not T20s. He scored today and was brilliant but he's not a consistent powerhouse. He takes too much time to get into the groove and start hitting. Those sixes he hits are beautiful to look at btw. Haris Rauf was fine. Better than expected. Shoaib Malik is absolutely useless against big teams. Minnow basher at best. I dont think he deserved his place on the team. 

Asif Ali did what he was best at but I feel we shouldnt reduce him to just a finisher. Give him proper guidance and make him come at number 4 position. Taking 1s and 2s is just as important and when the moment is right score those big sixes. Shadab was good. I dont really have complaints against him as a bowler but I wish his batting was better.

We have to remember that Australia dropped 2 or 3 regulation catches you while we batted. We have also had more than one match where we lost wickets and were in a losing position and then Asif Ali shows up and starts hitting from the first ball and makes us win.

We had 2 main issues imo. In this tournament we have seen that chasing 189 or 190 is still possible, defending 175 against Australia was always hard. New Zealand beat England this way too and I'm sure if we were chasing we would have beaten Australia too. So we were short about 20 runs if we really stood a chance to defend and secondly our no balls really hurt us today. I think we have the most no balls in the tournament but the other matches we didn't get punished for it as much. Today we had multiple no balls that were boundaries and free hits that weren't dot balls or singles. It takes away too much scoreboard pressure. 

So imo there are areas we should have done better. But overall they played way better than expected before the tournament began and we shouldn't lose sight of that and continue to build on it, hopefully in our ODI squad too.",0,5,1636654654.0

His performance needs to be sorted out. Whether that’s physical training, mental health counselling (for some reason he always looks like he has severe anxiety), or just a break from the team, it needs to be looked at.

jlxgsmf,t3_13tkgr2,"""What was the fault?""  
  
I am posting this after seeing all the evidence on the request of an overseas friend.  
  
These are foreign donors of Tehreek-e-Insaaf and Shaukat Khanum. Neither is active on any social media and has never been a part of any demonstration.  
  
A week ago today, an unknown number sent him a shameful video and pictures in which his widowed sister and 13-year-old niece living in a city in Punjab were completely naked in a police station. Even this 13-year-old girl has been photographed completely naked and sitting on the lap of various policemen.  
  
When this friend contacted Pakistan, it was found that this news was true and the family members had tried to hide the matter due to embarrassment and not to disturb this friend abroad.  
  
Long story short, after giving an affidavit, he will not take any legal action on this matter and will not provide any funding to Tehreek-e-Insaf or Shaukat Khanum in the future. Her sister and niece reached home.  
  
This friend immediately transferred his sister-in-law and her loved ones abroad using his connections and now mentioning this incident, narrated this incident..  
  
Their financial status is such that they can be any big lawyer in Pakistan, but they have no faith in the justice system of Pakistan and according to them, even if the criminals are punished, they will be suspended or dismissed or go to jail. They will be released or may be rehabilitated and awarded with rewards and honors as happened with the criminals involved in May 25 and Model Town tragedy.  
  
However, they say that whenever an independent and impartial commission is formed in Pakistan or abroad to investigate the circumstances of these atrocities, they will definitely take up the matter with all the evidence and as far as possible their widows. The sister and niece must also cope with the shock of this incident. This 13-year-old girl tried to commit suicide twice after this incident and is now being treated by a psychiatrist abroad.  
  
His only question is whether foreign funding was such a big crime that his widowed sister and niece were subjected to this brutality.  
  
He also said that how long the people of Pakistan and the government of this group of infidels are taking Pakistan towards, how long will the nation watch this spectacle. If they are there today, God forbid, tomorrow any of us may also be a victim of this brutality..!!",0,15,1685270722.0

"" قصور کیا تھا ""  
  
ایک اورسیز دوست کی درخواست پر تمام تر شواہد دیکھنے کے بعد یہ پوسٹ کر رہا ہوں .  
  
یہ تحریک انصاف کے اور شوکت خانم کے فارن ڈونیٹر ہیں . نہ ہی کسی سوشل میڈیا پر ایکٹو ہیں اور نہ عملی طور پر کسی مظاہرے کا کبھی حصہ بنے .  
  
آج سے ایک ہفتے پہلے ایک نامعلوم نمبر سے انہیں شرمناک ویڈیو اور تصویریں بھیجی گئیں جس میں ان کی پنجاب کے ایک شہر میں مقیم بیوہ بہن اور 13 سالہ بھانجی کی کسی تھانے میں مکمل برہنہ تصاویر اور ویڈیو تھیں . یہاں تک کے اس 13 سالہ بچی کو مکمل برہنہ کر کے مختلف پولیس والوں کی گود میں بٹھا کر بھی تصویر بنائی گئی ہیں .  
  
جب ان دوست نے پاکستان رابطہ کیا تو معلوم ہوا کہ یہ خبر درست ھے اور فیملی کے لوگوں نے شرمندگی اور ان دوست کو بیرون ملک پریشان نہ کرنے کی وجہ سے بات چھپانے کی کوشش کی تھی ..  
  
قصہ مختصر ایک بیان حلفی دینے کے بعد کے وہ اس بات پر کسی قسم کی قانونی کاروائی نہیں کریں گے اور آئندہ تحریک انصاف یا شوکت خانم کو کسی قسم کی فنڈنگ بھی نہیں کرینگے ان کی بہن اور بھانجی گھر پہنچ گئیں .  
  
ان دوست نے فوری طور پر اپنی بہن بھانجی اور ان کے عزیزوں کو اپنے تعلقات استعمال کرتے ہوۓ بیرون ملک منتقل کروالیا اور اب اس بات کا تذکرہ کرتے ہوۓ یہ واقع بیان کیا ..  
  
ان کی مالی حثیت ایسی ھے کہ یہ پاکستان میں کوئی بھی بڑے سے بڑا وکیل کرسکتے ہیں لیکن انہیں پاکستان کے نظام انصاف پر کسی قسم کا بھروسہ نہیں اور بقول انکے اگر مجرمان کو سزا ہو بھی گئی تو معطل یا برطرف کردیے جائینگے یا جیل جاکر پھر چھوڑدیے جائینگے یا ہوسکتا ہے دوبارہ بحال بھی ہوجائیں اور انعام و اکرامات سے بھی نوازے جائیں جیسا کے 25 مئی اور ماڈل ٹاؤن سانحے میں شامل مجرمان کے ساتھ ہوا .  
  
البتہ ان کا کہنا ھے کہ جب کبھی بھی پاکستان یا بیرون ملک کوئی آزاد اور غیر جانبدار کمیشن ان بربریت کے حالات کی تحقیقات کے لیے تشکیل دیا گیا یہ تمام تر ثبوتوں کے ساتھ اس معملے کو ضرور اٹھائیں گے اور جب تک ممکن ھے ان کی بیوہ بہن اور بھانجی بھی اس واقعے کے صدمے سے سنبھال جائیں . اس 13 سالہ بچی نے اس واقعے کے بعد دو دفع خودکشی کی کوشش کی ھے اور اب بیرون ملک ماہر نفسیات کے زیر علاج ھے .  
  
انکا ایک ہی سوال ھے کہ کیا فارن فنڈنگ اتنا بڑا جرم تھا کہ ان کے اس عمل کے باعث انکی بیوہ بہن اور بھانجی کو اس درندگی کا نشانہ بنایا گیا ..  
  
انکا یہ بھی کہنا تھا کہ ہمارا پاکستان والے اور اس بیغیرتوں کے ٹولے کی حکومت پاکستان کو جس طرف لے کر جارہے ہیں قوم کب تک یہ تماشا دیکھے گی . اگر آج وہ ہیں تو الله نہ کرے کل ہم میں سے بھی کوئی اس درندگی کا شکار ہوسکتا ھے ..!!",0,0,1685270712.0

I would encourage others to read the Guru Granth Sahib as it includes passages by Baba Farid. There are also passages by Guru Nanak Dev that express great love and devotion for the Prophet Muhammad (SAAW).

Were previous leaders pro-USA, and his win angered them?

Is Pakistan pro-China now? Aren't you worried that once you struggle to repay the loans, China will just take your infrastructure in lieu of the installments, like they have done so many times in the African countries - would that still be preferable to the IMF?

he was pro-China in the sense that we need good relations with our neighbours if we want peace and prosperity in our own land. he also wanted us to learn some things from China, like focus on long term planning, poverty alleviation initiatives, industrialisation, etc.

> Were previous leaders pro-USA

all of them were either pro-USA or at least wanting to be in the bad books of USA, except the founding fathers (Jinnah, Liaqat Ali Khan).

> his win angered them?

yes, because he was anti-US foreign policy. US policy in Afghanistan was a disaster for Afghanistan and Pakistan. he didnt want to give them airbases after US left Afghanistan. also USA is anti-China, and Imran Khan doesnt want USA to make Pakistan anti-China because its not good for Pakistan's peace and prosperity. 

> Is Pakistan pro-China now?

if you put a gun to peoples head and asked them to choose who to be closer to, China or USA, most would pick China because we will gain more from them since they are our neighbours. China has also done more for us than USA has ever done. we dont want to be pawns of the USA in their war against China, and we dont like USA's foreign policy ideas for Pakistan because its not going to help us in the long term.

> China will just take your infrastructure in lieu of the installments, like they have done so many times in the African countries - would that still be preferable to the IMF?

we owe more money to USA than China. at least China is willing to restructure our loans unlike USA, and everyone knows IMF is controlled by USA.",1,2,1650060003.0

Now that a religious party organizes one, now you remember COVID? Even though it was this protest that Ismail Haniyah, an actual Palestinian leader, acknowledged and gave a speech at. 

Also to all the idiots saying the protest was “too late”, is Palestine free yet? Did Israel stop killing children? The IDF attacked al-Aqsa not even 24 hours after the supposed ceasefire. 

To all the people saying “mUh eConOmY”; somethings are more important. Humanity, Muslim brotherhood, human decency, taqwa, these things are more important. 

To everyone saying “what’s the point”, you clearly don’t understand why people demonstrate and protest and march. This march was to show solidarity with Palestinians. It was to put political pressure on our leaders to actually do something instead of talking. It was to make an appeal to the public to support Palestinians with their tongues and their pockets and wealth. 

That’s why people march, that’s why people protest. Maybe it won’t work. Maybe it was all for naught. But when Allah ‎ﷻ‬ asks on the day of judgement, at least I can say I tried. At least I can say that I showed up and I spoke out.

Is this a joke? The rally was held for solidarity. This is obvious from the fact that Jamaat Islami had Shias and Christians speaking on stage. It was the largest demonstration in support of Palestine, and if you were actually there you’d know that there were a lot of non-religious people there as well. Not to mention the fact that JI got Ismail Haniyah who addressed the protestors. How was this for political posturing? JI invited multiple politicians from opposing parties and other religious parties. If it was for posturing, why would they do so? The Palestinian issue is a Muslim issue. This fact is what we’ve been saying and what Hafiz Naeemurrahman and Siraj alHaq repeated. 

On Thursday, liberals held a pro Palestinian rally in Karachi in front of Karachi Press Club. Where was the outrage then? Aurat March was held during the peak of the COVID wave. Did this sub condemn that rally? Why then is the only controversial demonstration the one held by Jamaat Islami? 

It’s obvious that this sub is dissonant from the general population of Pakistan. It’s mostly elite liberals, and expats who are dissociated from their own culture and only use it for diversity points in their new countries. This sub has anti Islam and pro liberal biases and for some reason it’s afraid to admit it, and this comment thread just confirms it.

The only reason Pakistanis (government and people) are beating their drums is because it makes them feel and look good without any long term blow back. Pakistan has no diplomatic or economic relations with Israel. Everyone goes out to protest against Israel and pat themselves on the back about a job well done. These protests are there just so people feel good about themselves (i.e. selfish reasons). Politicians make all these statements because the public likes them. Zero practical action is taken. Rhetorical speeches in front of the UN mean nothing. 

However, we ignore the same behaviour from our allies or places where we might be told to out our money where our mouth is. 

Pakistan/Iran/Turkey politicians are calling for a international observation force in Palestine because they know it will never happen. However, they do get brownie points from their public. How come there wasn't a peep about a force from any of these countries when the Rohingya genocide was being committed?

You say the first priority is to care for humanity and to hell with the economy. Why is it that out government does not say any about the persecution of the Kurdish people in Turkey. Our public is completely silent on the matter as well. Before you parrot the Turkish line of saying the Kurds are terrorists I would suggest you read up on Kurdish oppression in Turkey.

The majority (if not all) of the current Arab royal families fought against the Ottomans. House of Saud being a prime example. 
Saud, incidentally being the last person to march in Makkah with the intention of attacking it.

'..whether a person combines the entire phrase, “inshallah,” or puts one or two spaces, “insha Allah” “in sha Allah,” all these forms are permissible. This point is even clearer to those who have researched the transformation of the Arabic writing style (or any language for that matter) throughout the ages.[1] In every era, scribes wrote Quran and Hadith based on the style prevalent in their age and society. The same applies to the usage of diacritical marks and dots. If the permissibility of variant styles in Arabic was never contested in the history of Islam, why then should varying transliterations be contested?

As far as the claim that if one writes “inshaAllah”/ “inshallah” it will mean “create Allah,” this is incorrect. Firstly, because every reader and writer understands the purport of this word formulation. Just as words having multiple meanings are interpreted/understood contextually, so too will a transliteration be understood contextually. Secondly, the verb “create” is classified as فعل الأمر (imperative verb) in Arabic. The imperative form of “create” using the root word إنشاء is أنشئ (Anshi’ with a sharp ending, unlike an alif). When the word الله is joined to the imperative أنشئ, the final letter of the imperative is given a kasrah ( ئِ ) based on the rules of morphology: أنشئ الله. Technically speaking, the transliteration should then be “anshi illah.” It is therefore incorrect to scrutinize a transliteration based on the technicalities of another language.

In light of the above, the various forms of transliteration for “insha Allah” are permissible.[2] Delving into such intricacies only brings difficulty on a person.     ",6,2,1588431366.0

Rangers and FC are para military forces who recruit local people who know the area because most of their job/ work scope revolves around holding the borders until regular army arrives to reinforce the positions. Or like these days when they are used to maintain law and order in aid of civil power. Rangers and FC wings remain stationary so they cannot recruit people from other provinces as that would be an administrative disaster. Army units and regiments are satellite and they keep on re locating on bi yearly basis.

jeksarp,t1_jek3zb4,">Majority of women will be in hell because they have periods due to which they can't pray. Periods are given by God. He himself has set the rule of not praying during periods. And he himself is calling them less religious, and sending them to hell for that. This is highly illogical.

He's calling them less religious? Where do you have evidence to back this up? Men and women both will be judged based on the hardships that they have to face and Allah (SWT) is so forgiving that you can't even comprehend his forgiveness. 

In Sahih al-Bukhari 3321 ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because, passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of that.""

Just imagine this, Zina one of the biggest sins being forgiven just for this small action. 

Furthermore, if you want to know more about the status of women look at this hadith. 

In Sunan an-Nasa'i 3104 ""O Messenger of Allah! I want to go out and fight (in Jihad) and I have come to ask your advice."" He said: ""Do you have a mother?"" He said: ""Yes."" He said: ""Then stay with her, for Paradise is beneath her feet.""

This teaches Muslims to value and cherish their mothers and show them much love and respect.

&#x200B;

>Where are the phrases ""pious men"" and ""unreasonable women"" in the verse? Arrogance is a broad term and anything can he interpreted as such. In fact, men are allowed to beat their wives even if they ""fear"" arrogance from them. Women do not even have to act arrogantly, and they might get beaten.

I'm not sure where he got the translation of Qur'an 4:34 from but in this translation from Dr. Mustafa Khattab 

Qur'an 4:34 ""Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with. And if you sense ill-conduct from your women, advise them ˹first˺, ˹if they persist,˺ do not share their beds, ˹but if they still persist,˺ then discipline them ˹gently˺. But if they change their ways, do not be unjust to them. Surely Allah is Most High, All-Great."" 

It says if you sense ""ill-conduct"" from women then advise them first and then if she doesn't listen, then you can refuse to share beds. Then, if she still refuses you can discipline them lightly as the absolute last resort. The extent to which you nitpick verses and try to twist meanings, and interpretations are sad.

Not to mention just a few verses before this:

Qur'an 4:19 ""O believers! It is not permissible for you to inherit women against their will or mistreat them to make them return some of the dowry ˹as a ransom for divorce˺—unless they are found guilty of adultery. Treat them fairly. If you happen to dislike them, you may hate something which Allah turns into a great blessing.""

Furthermore, 

‘Ata said: ""I said to Ibn \`Abbas, what is the kind of hitting that is not harsh? He said, Hitting with a siwak and the like.""

If you look at this hadith it says:

In Sunan Abi Dawud 2144 ""I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him: What do you say (command) about our wives? He replied: Give them food what you have for yourself, and clothe them by which you clothe yourself, and do not beat them, and do not revile them.""  
  
If that is not enough then look at this from Sunan Ibn Majah 1851:

""'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark.If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.' ”",3,5,1680379696.0

jelxtcn,t1_jektf3c,"**The “Controversial” Verse**

Despite the Prophet’s inherent distaste for harm towards women, there has been an attempt to argue for the permissibility of domestic violence based on an interpretation of a specific verse from the Quran (4:34). Contention ultimately arises on the issue of spousal abuse in Islam from a misreading of this particular verse. This verse states that if a husband fears his wife's egregious or defiant behavior, he should follow a three-step procedure to solve the situation.16 First, he must verbally advise her against her actions and correct her mistakes. If this does not improve the situation, he must then ""abandon"" her bed as a display of his disapproval. If that too does not prove effective, then the final measure has been translated as administering a symbolic gesture of physical discipline (ḍaraba). This multi-step procedure was arguably instituted as a means to regulate an initial surge of anger by requiring the husband to essentially cool down and not impulsively inflict harm upon his wife.

On initial reading of this verse, many readers tend to be frustrated with the ostensible permissibility of a husband hitting his wife. For this reason, scholars have discouraged laypersons from seeking legal answers from the Quran unguided as comprehension of the text requires expert interpretation and contextualization.17 In fact, most Muslim sects agree that verses of the Quran can only properly be understood when read in light of other Quranic verses and the Prophetic model, as well as the interpretations and legal implementations of the scholarly elite. It was the scholars of each community who determined how this verse was not only understood, but what consequences could potentially follow if a husband wronged his wife in any way (i.e., physically or mentally).

In reality, the majority of scholars shared the Prophet's aversion to domestic violence and took measures to limit the apparent meaning of ḍaraba or physical discipline in verse 4:34.18 According to the famous early Makkan jurist ʿAṭāʾ ibn Abi Rabah (d. 732 AD), ḍaraba does not refer to hitting at all; rather, it is a symbolic gesture that reflects one’s anger.19 He firmly contended, ""A man does not hit his wife. He simply expresses that he is upset with her.""20 Al-Darimi (d. 869 AD), a prominent early Persian scholar and the teacher of the two most renowned compilers of Prophetic narrations, Bukhari and Muslim, composed an entire chapter of hadith (Prophetic narrations) that objected to domestic violence titled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women.'21 Some scholars even went as far as challenging the authenticity of narrations that supposedly allowed men to hit their wives. Ibn Hajar, a scholar considered a medieval master of hadith, asserted that in spite of the apparent meaning of the Quranic verse, the example set by the Prophet is sufficient proof that hitting one's wife is reprehensible. The nineteenth-century Syrian jurist, Ibn Abidin, moreover, declared that any harm that left a mark on the wife could result in the physical punishment of the husband.22

His modus operandi like the rest of the Jewish left has been to try and obfuscate the Adelsons, Kushners, AIPACs et al who puppeteer US foreign policy and distort it in favour of Israel and to portray Israel like some mindless dindu that will act nice once the West stops being mean or whatever else the typical Marxist line tends to be.

Anyhow Imran Khan is as fake as they get. The guy and the Pakistani establishment in general made 0 moves in preparation for India's Israel-like maneuvers in occupied Kashmir and has constantly thrown unconditional peace gestures India's way since then. He's a coward and so is the state he represents and were it people like him in charge of Palestine, the capitulation/surrender that Yasser Arafat pulled off in the Oslo Accords in the 1990s (acquiescing to Israeli occupation, dropping resistance without any promises of a state) would once again be witnessed.

Instead what we see is really noble and brave resistance right now from Palestine, supported by brave countries like Iran and its allies like Hezbollah. Not Pakistan, not that Israeli ally Turkey (not only because it has the Israeli embassy and trade ties, those are weak examples, but because it's been Israel's historical source of strategic depth in Syria and Iraq and has constantly helped Israel destabilize those two key Arab countries).",0,-1,1620884180.0

They don’t deserve this life just cause they were unfortunate to be born in a poor family, they should have the exact same opportunities to learn, play and grow up as all the other children not born into poverty. The hard truth is that the regular citizens of Pakistan share a large part of the blame for these unfortunate children. How? Well, we employ small children to play with, entertain or watch after other children in the house, Or employ them to help with household chores. We even treat them with contempt when we see them selling or begging out on the streets. This video just goes to show you that at the end of the day they’re still children and long for the same things and treatment as all the other children. Gift them something they can play with or eat like chocolate and their faces will light up. I know idiots will now be thinking ‘bUt iF We dOnT emPloY tHem THeiR fAmiLy woNt eAt,wE aRe hElpInG tHeM’. well, if you care so much then how about you do your own damn work and pay these children to go attend school or to just go out and play instead of working for you.

What I would suggest to you is to not have this shame shame attitude, as that doesn't really help. Rather, you should highlight the governance and political issues of the country, and focus your anger there.

Remember, what sets Palestine and Kashmir apart is the atrocities done on a Country level, which require collective condemnation. No one should advocate for war, unless they have to fight it themselves, so there I agree with you.

For street children and fighting the poverty visible on the streets, I just think setting up a federal and provincial welfare agency, combined with close working with Traffic and regular Police, would help. As one part of a bigger solution (lunch vouchers, health insurance etc.).",1,6,1621011398.0

Al-Bukhaari (5739) and Muslim (2219) narrated from ‘Abd ar-Rahmaan ibn ‘Awf (may Allah be pleased with him) that he said: I heard the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) say: “If you hear that it (the plague) is in a land, do not go there, and if it breaks out in a land where you are, do not leave, fleeing from it.” 

Al-Bukhaari (3473) and Muslim (2218) narrated that Usaamah ibn Zayd (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “The plague is a calamity (or a punishment) that was sent upon the Children of Israel, or upon those who came before you.

I will just talk about America as per my original response. Like you said ""they do whatever the heck they want to do"". My argument is [most people follow Christianity deeply in the U.S.](https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/). This is a link from a PEW study which, wtv your opinion, *are the facts American society uses*. The government decides critical policy based on what you call ""irrelevant"".

&#x200B;

>Their mainstream TV shows regularly mock religion and God.

An atheist Pakistani who moves to the U.S. will eventually realize that mainstream America is secular on the surface only.

What really happens in the U.S. is the e.g. [72 million Catholic Americans](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&sxsrf=ALeKk01urZOTbFACXlNpaNyOBIER-LViqA%3A1585564792330&ei=eMyBXo3cE8e4tAafq4_ICA&q=catholics+in+us+&oq=catholics+in+us+&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECAAQRzoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoHCAAQFBCHAjoHCAAQgwEQQzoCCAA6BQgAEIMBOgQIABAKUJH3NljoiDdgjYo3aABwBXgAgAFoiAGZCJIBBDE1LjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiN-NuRgcLoAhVHHM0KHZ_VA4kQ4dUDCAs&uact=5) send their kids to [1000+ private Catholic schools](https://www.university-list.net/us/rank/school-300036.html), universities and churches littered across the U.S. that, of course, don't teach secular topics like evolution and homosexuality.

America puts out probably the most sexual/violent content in the world but don't forget America also invented a moral censorship system with a secular disguise which are the ratings PG, PG-13, R, etc. as a national law which comes from a White Christian American morality.

Speaking of the Bible, [every hotel room in America has a copy of the Bible](https://www.mic.com/articles/182597/why-do-hotels-still-put-a-bible-in-the-nightstand) in the bedside drawer.  I think I heard one hotel also having the Quran because the owner was Muslim but don't quote me on that. This is not a law, people just do that.

>For simplicity sake, is the ""*Democratic* People's Republic of Korea"" (North Korea) a democratic country just because it has ""Democratic"" in the title?

**Morality is subjective.** If you judge the West with a Pakistani Muslim narrative of morality, you will of course view America as this infidel nation of gays who gamble, get high and fuck on the streets all day or wtv is your definition of immorality...the reality is America took 15 years to finally legalize gay marriage after the first country did. Marijuana is *still* a crime at the national level. That's all I'm saying: people may think America is more immoral than Europe but it's not.

These ""immoral"" legalizations were passed on democratically because of course high taxes are levied.

And of course Catholics aren't a majority @ 72 mil. Christians are. 70% of Americans identify as such to varying degrees and it *is* a big deal by western standards. I'll throw in another stricter group to further illustrate my point of how conservative/religious America is: the [15 million Mormons out of Utah](https://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/), a purely American version of Christianity that ""abstain from coffee and tea, alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs."" Also have a strict female dress code and no body piercing rules. Wow so moral! By the way, if you think they don't matter, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican Presidential nominee, is a practicing Mormon and that was a big talking point in his candidacy. Obama narrowly beat him in the popular vote by just 4%.

The U.S. is also where the Amish Christians come from. Why do I mention this group? This is a home-grown American invention of Christianity that makes even Mormons go ""WTF?"". They don't believe in using electricity, gas or any modern convenience and they dress *exactly* how their ancestors do. Doubt they will become atheistic anytime soon. They are only 250,000 people but pure numbers aren't even the point I'm making with the Amish...they still ride horses to work because of religious beliefs!! Where in Europe can you find this kind of belief system in 2020?

Personally, I'm an Atheist. I've lived in America for 10 years. I enjoy reading up on American politics and history (spoilers: there's not a lot to celebrate). If you ask me, present-day America has a much longer and complex way to go than the rest of the West to be free from religion just because of what America is: an experiment.",7,1,1585585291.0

""From musaylimah, messenger of God, to Muhammad ‎ﷺ, Messenger of God. Salutations to you. I have been given a share with you in this matter. Half the earth belongs to us and half to the Quraish. But the Quraish are people who transgress.""

Bro, most of these people saying that they're prophets are mentally ill and not in a sane state of mind. What you're saying is not cool. Islam does not teach us to kill people with mental illnesses (like that recent guy who Mr. PseudoGhazi decided to shoot in court) who know not what they do or say. Also, they have to be given the chance to repent which, I don't think you want them to have as seen when you say that they should basically be made an example of. 

On a final note, I would like to mention  **Tulayha ibn Khuwaylid ibn Nawfal al-Asadi** who declared himself a prophet during the Ridda Wars soon after Muhammad's death alongside Musaylimah. Unlike Musaylimah though, he later repented and went on to become a ghazi and great Muslim war hero during the War against the Sassanid Persians at the Battles of Qadisiyyah and Nahawand. Now tell me, would he been able to render such services to Islam and helped its cause if the noble Sahaba had decided to give him no chance to repent and straight up killed him as you are saying we should do?",1,8,1597309475.0

The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: Beware, if anyone wrongs a contracting man, or diminishes his  right, or forces him to work beyond his capacity, or takes from him  anything without his consent, I shall plead for him on the Day of  Judgment.

this is a more correct translation of the same hadith.

“Beware, if  anyone persecutes any peaceful non-Muslim citizen [Mu’ahid], or  diminishes his right, or forces him to work beyond his capacity, or  takes from him anything without his consent, I shall plead for him on  the Day of Judgment.”

Sunan Abu dawud 3052



there's also this one from sahih bukhari : https://sunnah.com/bukhari/87/52

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Whoever killed a Mu'ahid (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the  Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of  forty years (of traveling).

حَدَّثَنَا  قَيْسُ بْنُ حَفْصٍ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الْوَاحِدِ، حَدَّثَنَا الْحَسَنُ،  حَدَّثَنَا مُجَاهِدٌ، عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عَمْرٍو، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ  صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ ""‏ مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسًا مُعَاهَدًا لَمْ يَرَحْ رَائِحَةَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ رِيحَهَا يُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ أَرْبَعِينَ عَامًا ‏""‏‏.‏  Reference : Sahih al-Bukhari 6914


This hadith is about non muslim citizens.

How we should treat them.

How to deal with non muslims


Edit :Changed the link(If you have a better article please do share!).

I would like to add that A mu'ahid isn't a dhimmi, a dhimmi is someone who pays jizzya.

While a mu'ahid is simply a contractor who accepted to live in muslim land (he still has to pay a tax). Both their lives, property and honnour are to be protected.

Unfortunatly I couldn't find many article about the subject in english by muslims.

When did I imply in my post that they weren't going to kill him? Tulayha was literally at war with them during the Ridda Wars so of course, they wanted to kill him. You kill your enemies at war, not go around giving them hugs. 

Also, him being able to enter Umar ibn al-Khattab's presence and being given a chance to repent by Umar which Tulayha subsequently took was itself an opportunity that he was given. 

Judging by the way u/UsmanSaleemS is talking, however, it seems Umar should have killed Tulayha the moment he came into his presence and given him no chance to repent. With that said though, unlike OP, Umar actually had sabr as a proper Muslim should which is why he gave Tulayha the chance to redeem himself, a chance that OP, judging by his comments, would never have given to the mentally ill guy in the court.",3,2,1597343419.0

Allah has granted humanity the wisdom to contemplate and exercise basic common sense. It is illogical for Islam to promote the requirement of four witnesses for an act of rape, and even out of the blue they required four witnesses, wouldn't they do something to stop the rape and if they didn't, won't  they be illegible to stand as witnesses as Islam stresses the people of pity and exemplary faith can stand out as such in context of Zina?

This would seem unfair and an oppression against the victim, to bring out the requirement of witnesses, it is as if she is punished for something beyond her control.

""The Pen does not record (evil actions) against the sleeper until he awakes, or against the boy until he reaches puberty, or against the madman until he recovers his wits."" (Al-Hujwiri, *The Kashf al Mahjub*, 35I.)

According to that hadith then (which you'll probably call fake because it doesn't fit your agenda), an insanity defence then exists under the sharia for the mentally ill. If you still think it's okay to take the law into your own hands and go about murdering the mentally ill in the streets (who cannot be held responsible for their acts under the Sharia including any acts of blasphemy like the ones Tahir Nadeem committed), then you are clearly a jahil extremist whose actions serve no purpose but to break Islamic law and tarnish our noble faith's reputation like Mumtaz Qadri and those villains in Daesh did.  

Also, you claim that the Prophet's companions would not have hesitated at all to attack someone who claimed or was though to be Dajjal and yet, the case of  [Saf ibn Sayyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saf_ibn_Sayyad) shows otherwise. In his childhood, he claimed to be a prophet and was thought to be the Dajjal and yet the Prophet and his Companions left him in peace. Later, when he grew up, he then repented and became a practicing Muslim. According to you, however, the Sahaba should have disobeyed the Prophet's command to leave him be and killed him, thus not giving Ibn Sayyad the chance to repent.

No, hence why it is called Azad Jammu and Kashmir and Indian Kashmir is called Indian Occupied kashmir. Former are happy with Pakistan the latter want India out.

g1dep1x,t1_g1d3xgd,"That's the thing my dear it’s a matter of having the right and authority. That’s my question to you, who has the right and authority to do so? Or is it because it’s so obvious then everyone and anyone can, should must do it?

Let give you a simple example, for instance, you see a man killed someone with the eyes of your head in the day time that you could recognize this person even from 100 yards or a mile.

Do you then have a right to call him a murderer or are you an authority to declare him a cold-hearted killer? 

Most certainly you cannot, even though you have not the slightest doubt he is the murderer.

The only right you have is to file a report for him.

The court will do the trial and declare it as first-degree cold-blooded murder or an accident.

If it’s an accident, even then you won’t have any right to call the person a murderer. Because he is not guilty. Yours eyes cannot judge him anymore, if you will insiste that would be felony against the decision of court.

If he is declared a murderer and given a punishment then you may call him a murderer but it would not be necessary to call the person murderer like forever. Because even a murderer can repent and change do toubah, You won't be a polite person if you must call him a murderar Muslims are always polite. 

Now my dear Shirk, bidah, Kufar, Irtadad, are one of the utter sins and when Allah sends a prophet in any nation they also become the utter crimes. Only Allah has the right and authority to punish any human or nation on committing those sin/crimes during the time of prophet or on judgement day. He then gives this right and authority to his Prophet for a little time to give this punishment to absolute deniers. Allah also forgives those who commit these or any other sins as a mistake, mistakes are considered as accidental, but punishes hard to deniers, those who know in their hearts with absolute clarity what is the truth and then deny it. 

My dear doesn’t know about you but throughout my life, I have seen my Muslim brothers committing the utter sin of shirk to the same degree Hindus or monks or Amazonians do. and I call them Muslim brothers and I eat their zabiha and I pray with them and fast with them and Hajj with them give charity but I do not get in a matrimonial relationship with them, that’s where I have a right and authority to do so. I cannot call them Mushrik or Kafar. I only preach them, teach them, do the reasoning with them and maximum I say they are ignorant, may Allah purify their knowledge, they know Shirk is haram but they are doing it and it’s an utter mistake. Allah will judge them on the day of judgement.

No scholar or group of righteous people or Supreme Court, country, khilafa, or Jins or even a neuro AI computer that could read people’s mind has a right or authority to declare them Mushrik or Kafar. Please put a stone on your heart and understand that.

Allah has simply not given this right or authority to anyone.

If you think he has please educate me, I’ll be with you.

Now the followers of Mirza Ahmed Qadiyani are doing clear Kufar, they have started a clear new ummah, they have declared him another prophet. We are all eye witness of that we know it’s wrong we know it is unforgivable sin if they are doing it after an absolute clarity that it’s unforgivable and if they are making a mistake like our brothers who commit, bidah, Kufar, and irtadad then only Allah knows their hearts. We cannot judge them, we can only save ourself and do the reasoning with others why or why not.

Secondly I asked you, has Allah or his messenger made our duty to do so? That we have to put labels on people and declare who is who? Anywhere in Quran or Sunnah? I am sure no. You shared the ayahs yourself, it’s opposite. Instead, Allah wants us to take charge of our own life and make our own life as pure as possible, purify our body as much as possible, purify our food, purify our morality and show our deepest obedience to Allah and have fear of our own wrongdoings, especially with others and have the patience for all the hardships be deeply grateful for our blessings. This life will end and we will be rewarded by the forgiveness of Allah and his blessings for eternity. We are not here to judge others or monitor what they are doing. Allah will most certainly judge us all soon.

May he forgive us because we keep our heads down and do not arrogantly become judge or authority on sins Allah has not give any right to us.

All the laws created in many Muslim countries like you mentioned a few times are totally against Quran and Sunnah and hence are one of the many reasons why all Muslim countries are doomed and will remain unless they say salam to traditions and return to Quran and Sunnah and hold them tightly.

>what can we do when arabs themselves don't care about their bros in occupied palestine.

What does that have to do with anything? 

The Pakistani people are sympathetic to the suffering of the ummah in general.

This goes back to even before partition:

If you examine how we helped Turkey at a time when Pakistan didn't even exist; when our own empire had been conquered and our homeland was under British control, we understood what would happen to the Turks if the Western powers beat them as it had happened to us as well and we helped them avoid that same fate.

Then the scars of partition showed their effect on our mentality.

I believe that it is our experience from the partition with [East Punjab being ethnically cleansed of Muslims in Muslim-majority areas by better armed, better-organized,](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/did-sikhs-squads-participate-organised-attempt-cleanse-east-punjab-during-partition)[ and better-equipped non-Muslims](https://caravanmagazine.in/vantage/did-sikhs-squads-participate-organised-attempt-cleanse-east-punjab-during-partition) that drives us when such situations arise elsewhere. 

Our [actions in Bosnia](https://www.reddit.com/r/pakistan/comments/hprk61/a_brief_thread_explaining_bosnian_genocide_and/fxto5gn?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) where the Muslim Bosnians were being ethnically cleansed being a prime example. 

So why is it that Pakistan has gone from: 

* Diplomatically helping Muslim nations like Algeria and Indonesia to break out from Western colonialism in the 50s.
* Assigning men and material to wars fought against usurpers of Muslim territories in the 60s and 70s in Palistine.
* Backing proxies in Afghanistan that accelerated the Soviet Union's dissolving in the 80s
* Assisting Bosnians all the way in the Balkans in Europe during the 90s.

To basically just sitting tight to the point that even I sometimes say that ""Mard-e-Mujahid so rahey hai"". The answer seems pretty simple but is beyond complicated.

We hit our peak in the 90s a time in which we did not have to focus on any threats to our sovereign territory from the Western borders and could focus entirely on India.

Revealing ourselves as a nuclear power put the spotlight on us permanently and was immediately followed with sanctions. This was then soon followed by 9/11 which overnight warped the perception of Muslims across the world.

Not to mention that as soon as the US settled in Afghanistan they set up a puppet government that went back to claiming our territory and backing groups like the TTP with help from India.

In the ensuing proxy war, we lost an estimated 83 thousand people and over 120 billion USD and pretty much stagnated for the past 20 years. We'd been reduced to putting out fires at home.

But the geopolitical situation is changing and hopefully, we go back to playing an active role in the betterment of the ummah like we used to, it was one of the few good things our country has done in the world.",1,14,1620705651.0

In the first example it says passport in the parenthesis to clear confusion, there is a reason why the word will have fell out of use, and also at that time it will have been shortened from ""kaaghaz e rahdari"", which means ""Travel Document"". ""Kaaghaz e rahdari"" could literally be the formal version of saying ""rahdari"".

The fact is ""rahdari"" alone can mean Passport which is why it's in the dictionary with references, and it's why it also says:

رک: راہداری کا پروانہ

Meaning: ""Look for: Rahdari Ka parwana"", it was shortened to Rahdari, which means passport (but not necessarily just passport).

Like I said the word راہداری wasn't invented for the word ""passport"", definitions do and can changes over time.

You can translate a lot of words to mean ''passport''..

I'm not even trying to. I'm just saying that Rahdari should have been the word for ""passport"", that's all I'm saying. Even in the Napalese language, the word for Passport is Rahda**n**i and it is written on the actual document. Rahdari just didn't pick up in Urdu hence why passport is still used in official documents but my point is, Urdu is a separate language and isn't meant to be a pidgin of languages.

Just like 'nikah nama' means 'marriage certificate'. 

On the other hand, English words like certificate (سرٹیفیکیٹ) or record (ریکارڈ) are part of formal Urdu vocabulary. For example birth certificate is commonly referred to as paidaishi certificate or sometimes برتھ سرٹیفکیٹ. Urdu does not become a pidgin language just because it adopted English words..  where do you think all the Perso Arabic words in Urdu come from? Read history, they were introduced, sometimes as a deliberate act and sometimes just organically like languages evolved. Just like English does not become a pidgin language adopting Urdu words like 'jungle' ' loot' 'bungalow' 'pajama' 'shampoo' etc etc.

>Except the reference is from 1951, used alone as Rahdari. Not back in the 1800s.

That is invalid reference, since it literally is trying to explain away what 'rahdari' means in that context by adding passport in parenthesis. 

Point is, we already have an Urdu word for passport, it's 'passport'. Just like we Urdu word for rail is rail and computer is computer. You can't claim some other word is the correct word for these (even if you can find a Perso-Arabic equivalent and appropriate that change that word's initial meaning)..

Both are acceptable, cross or pass (the verb 'to pass')

> English words like certificate and record are part of formal Urdu vocabulary 

I don't object to that. I'm not saying that we shouldn't English vocabulary in Urdu, neither am I saying that loanwords shouldn't be used. I'm saying that we shouldn't use English vocabulary **in place of Urdu words**. Words that are actually part of Urdu. And yes, if you just consistently throw in Arabic, Persian, English words and not further your language, then in the end it does pretty much become a pidgin.

> That is invalid references

I did explain that.

> Point is, we already have an Urdu word for passport, it's 'passport'. Just like the Urdu word for rail is rail and computer is computer. 

That's because there is no suitable alternative to 'rail' or 'computer' and it's just easier to use loanwords than to make calques. But when words actually get formed, they shouldn't get stomped for loanwords, and I'm not just talking about 'راہداری' here but a lot of Urdu words.

> You can't claim some other word is the correct word  

I'm not saying that 'passport' isn't part of Urdu vocabulary! I'm just saying that at least on official documents it shouldn't be 'passport' when you have a good equivalent. And when it comes to usage, you could skim through Urdu documents or Urdu government websites and see that they've used 'technical' words when it would just be easier to use English loanwords, I'll try and find examples, but the fact is usage clearly doesn't even matter.

It's a simple of case whoever was in charge of designing the passport, probably just didn't know the Urdu for 'passport' and thought the appropriate word would be just 'passport', and the design has just been kept.",3,1,1620686189.0

frpl4zg,t1_fro26ur,"Well to start off politicians have stated on air that these deaths are fake (just like trump and his cronies) and it has given credence to conspiracy theories.

The *vast* majority no longer thinks the death toll is as high as it is. (Understand that when i say vast I really do mean it. I have yet to meet someone who doesn’t believe that death toll is as high as they say it is)

Now from here they have multiple theories.

The strain of virus in Pakistan isn’t as lethal. (The most rational of the theories i have heard by far but then again it is based on incomplete data Pakistan has collected so far and not an actual study of the strains it self)

Another is that the PM is faking the numbers to get aid.

One that fits into all of these theories is that once a person dies of non corona related reasons doctors label it as a corona death. The anecdotal stories attached to this are almost always that the patient had cancer.

Another is that since Europeans and later the Americans have committed genocides for a long time and so they are capable of the most atrocious acts therefore the Doctors are giving lethal injections to patients and killing them and so are pakistani doctors because they are corrupt and vile. (This theory fits into the one below)

The last and the one that takes the cake is that there is *No* virus. Its fake yahoodi sazish to bring about the new world order and all the governments of the world are in on it for their benefits and the bill gates chip thing fits into this theory somehow I don’t remember.

I don’t get how these morons can say that the deaths are higher than they actually are even though our death/infected are 4% lower than US. Fucking US, the country that has the infrastructure and the ventilators and shit to save people and some how they believe it should be lower for us.

The real reason for the lower percentage is actually because people are running away/bribing people to get the bodies released so that they can give janaza to their loved ones themselves.",3,3,1590358312.0

It is well documented that the ARU approached NCA UK to investigate 1-Hyde Park which led them to Malik Riaz and his 190 Million Pounds of assets. Which they froze and after about a year of investigation, Malik Riaz chose to settle the matter with them. Shahzad Akbar who was in the ""ARU"" brokered the deal between Malik Riaz and Pak Gov with Imran Khan's blessings and signatures. The NCA gives any assets it recovers back to the state, this time the money was transferred directly to the SC account as part of Malik Riaz's fine instead of the national exchequer.
I will reiterate all of this is well documented. There are press conferences from Shahzad Akbar and Fawad Chaudary where they defend Malik Riaz by making the good ol' ""it's a civil case not a criminal case"" excuse and when asked why the money is in SC saying ""SC is also part of gov"".",4,-3,1684024272.0

NCA sends any and all assets its recovers back to the state not the individual as that would make no sense. So what you are saying is proven wrong by the very article you have shared.
As for Pak being a party to the settlement or not, Pak might not have been present officially during the settlement negotiations. But Shahzad Akbar, the Special Assistant to the PM, sent a doc to Imran Khan which was approved by the cabinet without even opening it. Shireen Mazari has objected to the said doc on the record.
Not to the mention the money was sent straight to the SC account and Shahzad Akbar is on the record for defending it by saying that ""SC is also part of Pakistan"".
Pakistani Gov approved the transfer of money to SC account hence why it was sent to the SC account. Otherwise it should have been in the national exchequer. The state bank !",6,1,1684049655.0

Settlement means Malik Riaz lost and agreed to give up his 190 Million Pounds over to NCA hence allowing them to return the money back to the state where it came from which is Pakistan.

In anycase, won't it make more sense to investigate Malik Riaz himself rather than IK?",8,1,1684334949.0
jkid5cw,t1_jki8fep,"You just said that the government was not involved. This article proves that wrong by stating that the gov was part of the deal.   
This is some clever legal speak, the ""civil debt"" that they mention is actually a fine that was imposed on Malik Riaz by SC against the Malir Bahria Town Case for landgrabbing.

And as the article clearly states that the gov was part of the deal, it makes sense why the payment was made to SC instead. Without the gov's approval the NCA would not have sent it to SC, which was my entire point.  
NCA returns all the funds back to the state, not the party that they caught those funds from. If the state cuts a deal and decides it wants to give that person extra favors then that's on the state, not on NCA.",9,1,1684336836.0
jkigcn2,t1_jkid5cw,"So, there are several assumptions you're making.  


1) That the NCA was going to deposit it in the Govt of Pakistan's treasury, that is a huge leap of judgement. The matter would have inevitable gone to court in the UK, where the govt of Pakistan would have to spend large sums of money and years for a chance at *maybe* recovering the money. Which is why you'll note the phrase ""that the settlement does not represent a finding of guilt.""  


2) While IK handed out a ""huge favor"" to Malik Riaz. He himself got nothing in return. IK and his wife are trustees of the Al-Qadir trust, they are not beneficial owners. Malik Riaz is known to give such plots of land, another such is Bilawal house in Lahore which as you'll note has never been centre of much controversy.  


3) Even if there is some wrong-doing, how do you establish it through inquiry of just one of the parties i.e IK? Why is Malik Riaz completely absent from all this? An impartial investigation would be welcome, but as is this case is completely baloney and just another avenue of political persecution.",1,1,1684338082.0
jkigzzl,t1_jkid5cw,"Also the govt approved the deal, but it was not part of the settlement itself is what I meant i.e gave NOC. Hence it could not have influenced the deal.",1,1,1684338336.0
jlgxbcj,t1_jkid5cw,You should comment here more. We need more people like you to expose their flimsy logic full of feeded narrative by PTI's insane propaganda machine,1,1,1684957845.0
jkmh975,t1_jkigcn2,"**""The matter would have inevitable gone to court in the UK, where the govt of Pakistan would have to spend large sums of money and years for a chance at maybe recovering the money.""**   
Gov of Pakistan would have spent no money whatsoever if the case went forward as the NCA was prosecuting it. NCA is a UK Gov backed agency. Malik Riaz on the other hand would've had to spend litigation fees and might even have had to pay more fines as a result of a ""liable"" verdict which was highly likely. An assumption sure but considering the settlement, an apt one.  
*""There is a general principle that a party that loses a civil case will pay the other party’s costs. Civil litigants therefore need to exercise caution in deciding which cases to take to court. "" -* Taken directly from NCA's website.  
So Malik Riaz in the case of a liable verdict would've most likely paid for NCAs attorney fees too.  
*“The size of funds in this case is a step change from previous efforts and shows the importance of changes introduced by the Criminal Finances Act 2017. Although there is scant information about the specifics of the case, returning seized funds to the country of origin, as is proposed, is an obligation under the UN convention against corruption.” -* Duncan Hames ( Director of Policy at Transparency International UK ) commenting on this very case https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/03/pakistani-tycoon-malik-riaz-hussain-hands-over-pounds-190m-to-uk-authorities-nca-

The recovered assets are returned to the state. **""That the NCA was going to deposit it in the Govt of Pakistan's treasury, that is a huge leap of judgement.""** Check the asset recovery section of [https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/corruption/convention-highlights.html](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/corruption/convention-highlights.html) to confirm that the recovered assets are indeed returned to the state. I am not making any leaps in my judgement here, this is all well established. UK is a UN signatory, them not following this convention and handing Malik Riaz the money that they caught from him are leaps of judgment and logic.  
As for your assertion that this case is **baloney.** I have clearly indicated above how it is not. NCA is bound by UN conventions to send money to the state. Pak Gov made a deal with Malik Riaz and signed an NDA (Kingsley Napley have confirmed it) with the NCA. The money was then transferred straight to the SC as part of the fine imposed on Malik Riaz. So it's clear that the Pak Gov, Imran Khan to be specific, handed out this huge favour to Malik Riaz.  


And the arguments about Imran receiving or not receiving any benefit is beside the point.  He abused his power and allowed money that was owned by Pak to be used against a fine imposed on a corrupt land grabber Malik Riaz. Maybe the benefit was future support ? just because you can not establish an immediate benefit ( I don't know enough about Al Qadir to say anything) doesn't mean there wasn't an expectation of one or that there wasn't any wrong doing.  


Since this is getting way too long, Malik Riaz's gifts to other people like Bilawal have never been directly connected to such favors handed out to him. Again, i do not know the complete details of Al Qadir so i can not comment on that but a favor was handed out which is blatantly obvious considering all the facts.   
Malik Riaz is absent because he is not the one that abused his power to give someone a favor like this. Imran was the PM, he got that NDA approved by the cabinet. He abused his power. His SSPM Shahzad Akbar was directly involved and even spotted having meetings Riaz and Co in London.  
Malik Riaz should be investigated for having laundered/black money in UK and  for the alleged bribe he handed out in the form of a ""Al Qadir"" trust. I agree that Imran is being sinlged out and being victimised on this case but the case is legit.",2,1,1684411183.0
jkn17ad,t1_jkmh975,"Yaar this is getting way to long. I honestly see where you're coming from, and if I were in a civilized country I too would be pissed. Problem is we live in Pakistan, though I'm yet to see anything in written the case has never been about why IK returned the money to Malik Riaz and granted him this favor. Something that I would indeed like a deeper inquiry into.

It has always been focused on IK taking the Al-Qadir trust as kickback from Malik Riaz, which as I said is baloney because it does not matter. He is a trustee and not a beneficial owner. Hence they've never felt the need to call Malik Riaz in for inquiry.  

You can tell because the subject of investigation is Bushra bibi along with IK, and not Malik Riaz. What does Bushra bibi have to do with govt affairs? nothing, it's just a means of humiliating IK by focusing on the non-issue of Al-Qadir trust.


>Maybe the benefit was future support ? just because you can not   
establish an immediate benefit ( I don't know enough about Al Qadir to   
say anything) doesn't mean there wasn't an expectation of one or that   
there wasn't any wrong doing.  


That is indeed a morally grey area but it is not illegal, Bilawal house lahore is well known on the other hand was a gift for the ""support"" that PPP gave Malik Riaz in acquiring the land for Bahria town khi. I'd rather give IK benefit of the doubt for the time being rather than support ppp.

Also, I'm not intimately familiar with how the NCA operates, but I can not imagine that it would be merely be out of the goodness of their heart. If the NCA loses its case will the UK govt simply pick up the tab and Pakistan will just move on? I don't think it's ever as simple as that.",3,1,1684420326.0

It's like trying to replace the foundation of a building that's already built. Not gonna happen, unless you topple it and start over from the very beginning. Such issues cannot be addressed from one-off occurrences like this. And for them to be addressed people need to have the self-awareness to recognize the issue in the first place.

If someone is *this* indoctrinated, you'll have better luck destroying a brick wall with your bare fists. A suitable mindset can only be cultivated over time, by raising awareness through videos such as this. It was an outrageous situation, and the poster decide to post it - nothing wrong with that. I don't see why you're taking issue with it, to be honest.

If you try to be upfront with these kinds of people, they will literally lynch you. History has proven that time and time again. They will not listen no matter how hard you try. Again, I am speaking from experience. In most situations like this, you will be outnumbered - and it's their opinions against yours. People will listen to their emotions and their existing notions even if you bring up irrefutable evidence against them. It's useless.

I have no idea what to do about it. Whenever I think of mass ignorance like this I get lost in thought and drown in despair. So I have started to avoid thinking about it altogether.

And then you quote the Quran where it literally means you follow the humanity that the Prophet proposed for mankind along with your own logic in the situation at the time. Allah's requirements are so simple, be a good human being to others and here's the 100,000+ examples I have sent through the ages with the Prophet being the last one. You can't completely emulate another person, just their good habits no less someone you have never met or never known in a completely different time of the age and not knowing their culture or their struggles. I am going to deplore you to do some introspection because if this is your world view, in a few years you will be just a slightly less extreme version of the Mullah in this video.

Even if you don't believe or believe in whatever thought process in your theological output, that's between you and Allah. Real iman for others doesn't need a measure from another faulty human being aka you or anyone else. My relationship with Allah is my own and I don't need to validate anyone, especially you.

Try talking about this issue to an Uighur, there are many who are living in Pakistan, wo shayad apko bata dein kitna hi western propaganda hai aur kitna sach hai. I have a friend who has not been able to contact his extended family for 6 years now.

Regardless of all the photos, videos and testimonies that may very well be doctored, look up the Xinjiang papers. Funnily, China had very contradicting statements about them which gives you reason to suspect that there is something going on. The Foriegn Minister says that these govt reports were ""hyped up out of proportion"" and leaking them ""was an attempt to discredit China's deradicalization attempts"". Then the Xinjiang Governor claims that they are totally fabricated lol. Bro which one is it? ""made up"" ya ""blown out of proportion"".  
Also China's own stance of going from blatantly denying that anything is going on in Xinjiang to putting it under the pretext of counter-terrorism is ridiculous too. If there is any propaganda here I believe its Communist propaganda, like lmao if you're pressed to release a song about how peaceful Xinjiang is then its quite evident there's a skeleton in your closet. Like ye koi nayi baat nai hai ke China is hiding up stuff, they've done that previously in the Tiananmen Square massacre and even with COVID.

 As for services, It's basically the same except that Gaza is often denied those services, you have a naval blockade including the fact that Error 404 patrol boats harass palestinian fishing boats.

HDI is a little complicated. Since Error 404 occupies almost all of Palestine's land excluding Gaza, they have relatively good infrastructure and services BECAUSE Error 404 treats the area as if though they own it. Since UN does not recognize that as Error 404 land, they put that area's HDI into Palestine's which makes it seem as if though Palestine is high on HDI which in reality, it's probably lower than Pakistan's.

You really are joking, Pakistan's security is relatively better then that of Palestine, you don't have Paramilitary forces arresting children and locking them in cages like animals. As I mentioned, you don't have a fear that a war plane will just drop missiles on you

* The Quran is the general code for the Muslims, a religious, social, civil, commercial, military, judicial, criminal and penal code. It regulates every thing, from the ceremonies of religion to those of daily life, from the salvation of the soul to the health of the body, from the rights of all to those of each individual from morality to crime; from punishment here to that in the life to come, and our Holy Prophet Mohammad (Peace by upon Him) has enjoined on us that every Musalman should posses a copy of the Quran and be his own priest. Therefore, Islam is not merely confined to the spiritual tenets and doctrines or ritual and ceremonies. It is a complete code regulating the whole Muslim society, every department of life, collective and individual. Eid-ul-Fitar message (September 1945)

I do not know what the ultimate shape of this constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be of a **democratic type, embodying the essential principle of Islam.** Today, they are as applicable in actual life as they were 1,300 years ago. **Islam and its idealism have taught us democracy.** It has taught equality of man, justice and fairplay to everybody. We are the inheritors of these glorious traditions and are fully alive to our responsibilities and obligations as framers of the future constitution of Pakistan. In any case **Pakistan is not going to be a theocratic State to be ruled by priests with a divine mission. We have many non-Muslims — Hindus, Christians, and Parsis — but they are all Pakistanis.

You may belong to any religion or caste or creed -- that has nothing to do with the business of the State. As you know, history shows that in England conditions, some time ago, were much worse than those prevailing in India today. The Roman Catholics and the Protestants persecuted each other. Even now there are some States in existence where there are discriminations made and bars imposed against a particular class. Thank God, we are not starting in those days. We are starting in the days where there is no discrimination, no distinction between one community and another, no discrimination between one caste or creed and another. We are starting with this fundamental principle: that we are all citizens, and equal citizens, of one State. The people of England in \[the\] course of time had to face the realities of the situation, and had to discharge the responsibilities and burdens placed upon them by the government of their country; and they went through that fire step by step.

The same world view ushered in the era where children who weren't killed in the womb are so broken that they can't even tell what gender they belong to.

Typical westernized house slave. Secularism is a discriminatory principle which allows for even Hitler's national socialism to be the state ideology but not any religious ideology. You allow discrimination when it suits you. filth!. Islam offers something far superior than imposing someone elses ideology on a people who don't believe init. Christians, hindus, buddhists, muslims have their own civil code. Why would we want some other ideology imposed on us, when we can simply be ruled by our own ideologies. 

The difference between an athiest and a muslim is this. A muslim wants his gov to impose Islamic laws on himself because those are the laws he lives by.

Yes, religions have their own civil code. Do you know how the best way to allow every person to follow their own religious code? By having a secular state. In an Islamic state, non-Muslims are subjected to Islamic laws. In a secular state, the state has no relation to religion, so you're free to practice your religion (of course, until it affects others negatively- which is in inevitability with extremists like yourself). Islam doesn't offer anything better, other than being an archaic, flawed ideology.

gxzhn2l,t1_gxzdqp1,"on the basis of 2 nation theory:

In Muhammad Ali Jinnah's All India Muslim League presidential address delivered in Lahore, on March 22, 1940, he explained:

It is extremely difficult to appreciate why our Hindu friends fail to understand **the real nature of Islam and Hinduism. They are not religions in the strict sense of the word, but are, in fact, different and distinct social orders, and it is a dream that the Hindus and Muslims can ever evolve a common nationality**, and this misconception of one Indian nation has troubles and will lead India to destruction if we fail to revise our notions in time. The Hindus and Muslims belong to two different religious philosophies, social customs, litterateurs. They neither intermarry nor interdine together and, indeed, they belong to two different civilizations which are based mainly on conflicting ideas and conceptions. Their aspect on life and of life are different. It is quite clear that Hindus and Mussalmans derive their inspiration from different sources of history. They have different epics, different heroes, and different episodes. Very often the hero of one is a foe of the other and, likewise, their victories and defeats overlap. To yoke together two such nations under a single state, one as a numerical minority and the other as a majority, must lead to growing discontent and final destruction of any fabric that may be so built for the government of such a state.

In 1944, Jinnah said:

**We maintain and hold that Muslims and Hindus are two major nations by any definition or test of a nation. We are a nation of hundred million and what is more, we are a nation with our own distinctive culture and civilization, language and literature, art and architecture, names and nomenclature, sense of values and proportions, legal laws and moral codes, customs and calendar, history and tradition, and aptitude and ambitions. In short, we have our own outlook on life and of life.**

Allahabad address by Allama Iqbal

Commenting on the Hindu fears of religious rule in the Muslim autonomous states, Iqbal said:

Muslim demand is not actuated by the kind of motive he imputes to us; it is actuated by a genuine desire for free development which is practically impossible under the type of unitary government contemplated by the nationalist Hindu politicians with a view to secure permanent command dominance in the whole of India. Nor should the Hindus fear that the creation of autonomous Muslim states will mean the introduction of a kind of religious rule in such states.

This was the only form of tax that people had to pay under an Islamic empire. They did not pay any other tax. It was only paid by men not women or children nor the elderly. They had to pay less tax then the Muslims who had to pay double the normal and the zakat tax. Under nation states people have to multiple forms of tax and there is no need for it. The sole purpose was to ensure minorities rights were protected by the state. Since Pakistan state can do an all citizens can pay tax and gst in many forms it is not required anymore as economic models have changed.

I got your number pappu, which is why you don't like me exposing the degeneracy that is normalized when atheist grow in a society. You still trying to use the old trope, 'atheism is simply disbelief in a God'. No shit, of course that is what what atheism is. What happens to an athiest when they no longer identify with a moral framework? They still need morals to function through life, don't they.? So what do these morons do, where do they go fetch a new morality from? They blindly end up following the dominant global culture's morality. Secular liberal humanism. Your atheist profits tend to agree with each other's morals. Majority of western and westernized house slave atheists follow the same moral framework. Its amazing that I have to spoon feed you these things. lol. Not much free thinking going on in that head when you act like good dog and follow along the goray. 

Now, since you think you can try to hide the filth that is produced by atheists, howz about you kindly show me where world famous atheist speakers like Sam Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, Krouse actually denounce bestiality. Not sure that u can, because the clips below show their endorsement of it.

You also don't need to be confused about the incest point because your very own atheist profits whose idealogy you follow also accept incest with out children as an acceptable practice. Another nasty behavior atheists seek to normalize. 

Its the wealth of literature about morality with out God is what shows that the athiest if they were honest would have to off themselves because living the reality of atheist existence would have to lead the atheist to accept that there is no value in life. Killing a baby is no different than smashing a rock, just rearrangement of matter and energy. Yet this here is another reason why bestiality tourism is now a thing in european countries with the highest rates of atheism. Freaks!!!

Can't use cliche's on me babydoll. The point remains secularism is a discriminatory principle  which allows for even Hitler's national socialism to be the state ideology but not any religious one. Do uncomfortable argument often cause you to flail and divert the discussion because thats what seems to be happening here. 

Islamic humanism aims to maximize human happiness, not the atheist humanism. Atheist humanism seeks to break down social order and society. Tell me again which societies can no longer breed worth shit. Which societies have kids who can't even figure out what their gender is. Its not religious or communitarian societies, I can tell you that much. Its the societies where atheism is growing. 

You're little brain still hasn't figured what I was trying to educate you on, society functions when society IMPOSES obligations on its members. Individualistic societies that breed atheism don't do that. They are only concerned with their rights and no one dares speak about the obligations of a people to the society. Obligations which ensure essential social functions continue to be carried out by its members in order to keep a society healthy. So how do these backward individualistic societies function? ding ding ding, a big strong state with its over arching institutions keep the society organized with the use of violence. Since you gave up the morals that create stable societies, your state now tells you what your morality will be. Bestiality ? check. Incest? check. Tranny kids? check. women's exploitation? check.

You can claim it isn't mandatory, but then you're saying the Quran prescribed unnecessary things- I'm unsure if you want to go down that road. Saying it's not required anymore surely constituted bid'ah. 

Regarding the reason for jizya, the Quran itself says its to subjugate the dhimmi (my not be verbatim), and Ibn Kathir's tasfir says it's to disgrace and humble the dhimmi. So to suggest it's entirely about protecting their rights is wrong.

I literally posted what he said in his speech. I am not talking about what happened and what others thought, I said that Jinnah wanted secularism, and he did.

Secularism isn't inherently Western. It just happens to be adopted in the West more. Appealing to tradition is a fallacy- just because it's traditional, it doesn't make it right. When have I dehumanised anyone? You're throwing a tantrum at a monster you created in your head.

Oh yes, Muslims who are famous for their intellect. Believing in Muhammad going to heaven on a winged donkey with the face of a man, believing humans are made of clay, that Muhammad was made of light, believing sperm originates from between the backbone and the ribs, that there's a barrier between salt and fresh water, you got me there pal. You don't understand atheism if you think it entails any type of morals. There are so many different ideas of non-theistic morality, such as egoism, Sidgwick's knowable fundamental axioms, Kant's categorical and hypothetical imperatives, etc. There are issues with the divine command theory that you subscribe to, the most famous example being the Euthyphro dilemma. But you just happened to be born into the correct system, right? It totally has nothing to do with your ancestors getting conquered and you continually simping for the religion of the oppressor. You simply assert that atheists tend towards the same belief. You are just an idiot that keeps asserting things. Secular morality is so varied, it can be derived from the theories I mentioned before, or any other ones. There are examples of secular morality all throughout Asia's history, long before the goray. I know you're still colonised in your mind, though (happily colonised by the Muslims, but you feel insecure about the goray). 

\>Dawkins

First of all, he says he opposes those things. The argument is a philosophical one, but an uncomfortable one, sure. However, let me be charitable to you, even though you would never be to me. Let's say Dawkins said it's okay to have sex with children. Guess what? It doesn't reflect on atheism at all. Just because he's a well-known atheist, it doesn't mean it has anything to do with atheists. Again, atheism is just the lack of belief in god, it is not a belief system, just as 'not playing golf' is not a sport. But let's go down the paedophilia route, then. How old was Aisha? How old was Muhammad? What about when he 'thighed' her before he consummated the marriage (leading to multiple fatwas on the permissibility of thighing)? You really shouldn't be mentioning all this nonsense without realising your prophet is the biggest perpetrator. 

Again, there are no atheist prophets. You are the ones who emulate everything Muhammad does, down to growing a beard, how he sits, having multiple wives (though you can't have as much as him...how convenient for him), removal of body hair, how you go to the toilet, etc. You also have to defend every reprehensible thing he did, such as fondling his child bride, all the offensive wars. him attacking his own people in the caravan raids, saying the murder of a woman who slandered him was permissible, having slaves and being a slave trader, slaughtering a tribe and sleeping with the most beautiful woman of the tribe right after, etc. Continue simping. If Dawkins, Denett, Harris, Hitchens, Singer, Law, and any other prominent atheist/atheist philosopher says something objectionable, I'd object. You, however, *have* to accept any reprehensible thing your prophets do, because your religion requires you to simp. 

Islamic humanism? LOL. Humanism puts people at the centre of morality, regardless of what they believe. Islam *cannot* do that. Islam murders gays, apostates, 'fornicators' (or lashes them), subjugates women, censors speech- the shariah is a police state. There is no way Islam can be reconciled with humanism unless you reform Islam (yes please!). Laughable. And you keep parroting right-wing, Fox News talking points. The overwhelming majority of people (and children) in the West accept the traditional gender binaries. You're once again fighting against a monster you made in your mind.

No one gets murdered for speech, women don't get subjugated (at least not to the degree as they do in Islamic nations) , Islamic countries are a cesspit. Because education in secular countries is so much better, the state doesn't need to impose values on them. You're unironically simping for authoritarianism LOL. Again. Incest? Yes, Islam allows for cousins to marry and procreate, whereas incest is illegal in illegal in the vast majority of secular nations. Bestiality? Illegal in secular nations, just another strawman. Women exploitation? You're going crazy now. Women in secular countries have 1000000% more rights than in Islam. In Islam they are relegated to being house slaves and wearing bags. Get out of here with that rubbish. 'Tranny kids'? Once again, Fox News talking points, no need to even address that. You're drowning, kid.

I see your an ex Muslim if the Pakistaniyat movement which is a pan Islamic movement was supposedly meant to be secular. There is simply no hope for people like you. You want a cake of a part of history you seculars never had. However tolerance of opinion is accepted. Seethe all you like thank Allah for the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. Thank God for Quaid e azm and thank God for Allama Iqbal who gave the idea of 2 nation theory.",3,2,1620922757.0
gxzk0nq,t1_gxzik21,"tax itself is paid to state in many different ways such as GST since economic models have changed it is the same result. What part do you not understand this was the only form of tax that men only paid. There was no other tax. Therefore since there are more taxes which all citizens pay including minorities which the state has vowed to protect their rights. It is basically the same thing. Minorities and Muslims have have to pay tax broken down into smaller components the result is the same thus this is how nation states have adapted. Simple.

Also plenty of research has been done to debunk the subjugation of the minorities. More cope from the facists.

jizya paid by Jews under Islamic rule provided a ""surer guarantee of protection from non-Jewish hostility"" than that possessed by Jews in the Latin West. The Pact of Umar, which stipulated that Muslims must ""do battle to guard"" the dhimmis and ""put no burden on them greater than they can bear"",. Yaser Ellethy states that the ""insignificant amount"" of the jizya, as well as its progressive structure and exemptions leave no doubt that it was not imposed to persecute people or force them to convert. Julius Wellhausen held that the poll tax amounted to so little that exemption from it did not constitute sufficient economic motive for conversion. Similarly, Thomas Arnold states that jizya was ""too moderate"" to constitute a burden, ""seeing that it released them from the compulsory military service that was incumbent on their Muslim fellow subjects."" He further adds that converts escaping taxation would have to pay the legal alms, zakat, that is annually levied on most kinds of movable and immovable property.

He did not say that he wanted no religion in the eyes of the state only that state does not discriminate nor the people among themselves. Where religious divide does not exist. It does not say to abandon our religious principles in favour of secularism. That was your inane conclusion. More coping from you no doubt.

Tradiation, culture and religion mattered it was the case for our 2 nation theory defence. Get over it. Your convientatly are not understanding that when we made Pakistan the Muslims of India consciously adopted Islam into their lives it marked the end of colonialism being the reason for Islam. Islam was chosen by the indigenous inhabitants when Pakistan was made. Yeah cope even further. I suggest you read Quaid e azm and Allama Iqbal view on Marxism it’s not popular.",3,3,1620919441.0

The burden is on Muslims to follow the sunnah and and to follow his peaceful teachings which led a tolerant, diverse, equal empire where there was no poverty, no homelessness, no discrimination nor injustice.

Ibn Kathr interpretation which is what a tafseer is in which scholar gives his own personal comments not a hadith. It would appear he is more popular in the salafi school of thought thus not a mainstream scholar. Though as extinguished his works maybe. Many scholars that are sunnis and Sufi would disagree and find a way to adapt the principles. This was done by many scholars like ahmed bin hanbal  and others. I would disagree because many Islamic empires and even scholars had discussed the methods of business dealings, transactions by working with problem and seeing what’s popular with the masses if there was no appropriate solution in the texts such is the case of a modern nation state taxation model. Many Islamic empires abolished  jizya in many periods of their rule and all Islamic nations states decided that since all citizens will be paying various forms of tax and all the citizens rights will be protected the essential idea and principle  essentially remains the same of a) minorites paying tax b) Muslims paying zakat and tax c) nation states following examples like the pact of umar, treaties and constitution ensuring that all their rights are protected. The tax model we have today is valid.

if one scholar has a hardliners opinion that does not mean the rest of the scholars and certainly government officials or the masses will share that opinions. Scholars provide an opinion or a comment they cannot make decision on behalf of the state and certainly cannot be political. However they offer an opinion on said problem.

gxzr34c,t1_gxzn2ye,"I don't think you understand. Having an Islamic system will *always* favour Muslims. Having a secular system will be more equal for people of all faiths and non-faith. You just want to have a system based on what you were raised to believe, not because you think it's more equal. 

And now you're just handwaving Ibn Kathir. There are others who corroborate him, such as this paper saying the Fuqaha considers jizya as a badge of humiliation for not being Muslim. Just because minorities pay tax, it doesn't mean it's the same as the jizya, this is bid'ah (and I'm all for it). The Quran itself even mentions those who pay the jizya being subdued:   
*Fight those People of the Book who do not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day, and do not take as unlawful what Allah and His Messenger have declared as unlawful, and do not profess the Faith of Truth; (fight them) until they pay jizyah with their own hands while they are subdued.*

I'm sorry, but you are trying to rationalise this post-hoc. 

It is also interesting that you consider Ibn Kathir just one 'hardline scholar'. 

[https://quranx.com/tafsirs/9.29](https://quranx.com/tafsirs/9.29) 

Here are 4 other, classical, well-respected tasfir, and all corroborate the negative connotations of the jizya. Are you going to dismiss these as one-off hardline scholars, too?

So no, an Islamic system is by means not more equal than a secular one. We have very much diverted from Jinnah's opinions, which I showed were secular.",6,3,1620922442.0

[https://youtu.be/5udG-DiQ5cw](https://youtu.be/5udG-DiQ5cw)Yes indeed as it is an Islamic republic greater focus will be put to promote Islamic ideals and principles. In the same way many secular countries like France will implement their own cultural values at the detriment of others. Secularism under Marxism had dire repercussions. Certainly under secular regimes like Mao and Stalin.  A secular framework in practice even if your remove all gender, racial and other forms of discrimination will still not function if the society at large will elect Extremists into the parliament like India. Even the general nature of culture, gender roles and various ideologies. There is nothing in Jinnah speeches that showed his defence of secularism simply the promotion of equality among all of humanity and tolerance that can coexist in Islam.The nature of tafs is providing and opinion by the said scholar it is not a hadith.

I’ll have to do more reading on the context behind the quote and history of it. But what is clear Muslims cannot unlawfully claim the wealth of minorities . if memory serves me correctly this was due to the aftermath of Jewish tribes breaking the treaties and agreement they had over a certain issue which led to widespread poverty and deaths for Muslims. Due to the agreement not be faithfully done by the Jewish tribes it allowed muslims to claim only what is fair not anything unlawful based on the agreements.",7,2,1620923244.0
gxztkd7,t1_gxzsyzt,"The speech I linked explicitly said there should be no relation between religion and state, and that Jinnah hoped that a person's religion was of no importance to the state. That isn't what the shariah teaches, that is secularism. You can't run from this fact. 

Muslims, like any other religious groups, did religious conquests. Once they run the area, they ask for jizya because it is required by the Quran. That is how they 'lawfully' obtain jizya, but strongarming the minorities using the shariah state. I don't think the tribes consented to being slaughtered and taken over.",8,1,1620923494.0

Your view on Jinnah is based on one quote which is severely misrepresented. Islam promotes tolerance the state where the state Does not interfere in a person religious practice. This has been found throughout history. This is what he had wanted. Which is what history and biographies and countless people who were witnessed to him and himself many times have told.

She has cited her love for Pakistan and how she feels proud to be Pakistani. She’s stated that she’s a proud and practicing Muslim.

Mindset is important, and for the development of our country it must surely change. We must encourage and actively promote education and erudition but religion cannot be left out. 

If you look at many secular and areligious countries today, liberalism is rampant. And this (especially for the identity of the country) can do more harm than good. 

I see in the future that if Pakistan is to succeed religion must play a different role. As in being more of a personal, individual matter. For the morals and laws would not come from mullahs and imams but instead from state guidance.

Yes I agree that it is not big enough to be a political problem, but it is still significant. The identity crisis I'm talking about is actually a much more nuanced topic which includes geography as well. Turkey even has a problem identifying as either European or Asian. That also relates to how the eastern parts of turkey are more religious than the western. 

>I don't know if you have ever been to Turkey or know Turkish culture much but you are absolutely misinformed about the understanding of secularism here. Most of the population are Muslims who don't really care about the practices but nobody can push for ''anti-secularism''

I'm going to have to simply disagree with you here. I know I am not Turkish so I don't know the ground reality, but perhaps this actually requires a distant view which can look to Turkey as a whole. Turkey is split in between having religious Muslims and non-religous Muslims and the split is about even. I actually agree with you that the religious Muslims do not have a political campaign against secularism and neither do all the religious Muslims even care about secularism that much, but the ones that do definitely exist and they are not simply insignificant. I even remember one of the parliament speakers of Erdogans party spoke about how Turkey should have an Islamic constitution which became quite a controversy. Erdogan used the religious Muslims for his political base and that is evident, he simply did not speak out against secularism but perhaps someone else in the future might, and I'm pretty sure most of the religious Muslims will rally behind that. It is evident there is a general attitude many people have to move towards a more Islamicized Turkey, that simply cannot be denied. 

I also have a Turkish friend who I discuss general ideas with so I'm not just speaking from thin air. It sounds cliche I know but you're going to have to take my word for it.

It is quite evident Pakistan was built for Islam. I think you may be mistaking the words ""Muslims"" and ""Islam"" as being contrasting. The entire idea of Pakistan was that ""Muslims"" would get a homeland. When a group of people choose to identify themselves as ""Muslims"", rather than their ethnicity, they are putting precedence on their identity of belong to a religion. That religion is Islam. Even the definition of a ""Muslim"" means one who submits to God while ""Islam"" means submission. I mean, if it wasn't for Islam, there would be no Muslims. There is no other way to look at it except that if it wasn't for Islam, Pakistan didn't need to be created. 

> Also, when it was created it was ""Dominion of Pakistan"" not an islamic republic.. All the theological islamic republic stuff was added on later... 

This wasn't because Pakistan would not be going towards an Islamic government system, but rather that it was still in its infancy. Even then, the ""Dominion of Pakistan"" is still an Islamic country simply because of the fact that it was built for the identity of Islam. And to confirm this, here is a quote which solidifies my argument. 

*""The Constitution of Pakistan is yet to be framed by the Pakistan Constituent Assembly, I do not know what the ultimate shape of the constitution is going to be, but I am sure that it will be of a democratic type,* ***embodying the essential principles of Islam.

> If you make it a secular country Pakistan would still exist for Pakistanis. The land/ people/ institutions are not going to evaporate into thin air. 

Yes the institutions would not evaporate, but the spirit and identity of a nation would. This will lead to the inevitable decline of institutions as well. The simple core reason Pakistan exists today is because our forefathers decided to identify themselves as ""Muslims"" first before their ethnicity. Islam is the Volksgeist of Pakistan.

Nations face problems. So do Islamic states, so do secular states. The problems you face is not always because you are either an Islamic state or a secular state. The problems Pakistan faces is not because it is an Islamic state and Pakistan will face the exact same problems even if it becomes secular.

fs1kh6w,t1_fs1gw3g,"Firstly, escaping Hindu oppression was not the sole reason nor the core reason for Pakistans creation. Escaping Hindu oppression was just one of main points talked about in the Two Nation Theory. And in the Two Nation Theory, it also details Islamic principles, ideals and governance based on them and even the concept of the ""Ummah"". Just look into the views of Allama Iqbal, who is a main contributor to the Two Nation Theory and is also considered to be the one who actually brought forth the initial idea of Pakistan, which the Qauid made into reality. 

Second, a secular Islamic country is an oxymoron. You can be a Muslim majority country sure, but it is no longer an ""Islamic"" country. As I explained before, both Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Allama Iqbal wanted an Islamic state on the basis of the Two Nation Theory. Even the majority of people in Pakistan want this. To simply abandon that would be going against the very foundations of Pakistan, but also going against the will of the people. 

I've already quoted this before but this once again proves what Pakistan was always meant to be.

But the fact that Pakistan was founded as an Islamic nation doesn't necessitate that it stays that way.

So if we're discussing whether Pakistan should be secular or Islamic, it should be on the basis of whether shifting to a secular system would bring more practical harm or benefit in the present and future. Simply saying this: Pakistan's founding as an Islamic nation can't be used to justify its continued existence as such. ""Abandoning the foundations"" of Pakistan doesn't have to be a terrible thing. Building new societies and making progress requires some dimunition of traditional principles.

Its true some good can come from adapting and evolving, but harm can come as well. Sticking to the roots is of value and not only is it safe, its efficient but it can also cause stagnation. So the best thing is probably a balance in between.

However, I think people don't understand or even realize just how significant Islam is in the political realm. Islam is not like other religions in the sense where it is a ""Private"" religion, but it comes packaged with political, judicial and government rulings. By going towards secularism, you may think you can preserve Islam by making it private, but it actually undermines it. By separating religion from state, you are literally ripping off entire parts of Islam. That is not acceptable and nor will the general population of Pakistan ever accept that either. Secularism or mainly western secularism is simply ""Incompatible"" with Islam. I elaborated on this point here. Its a long read but its quite insightful on understanding Islam and secularism.

This is a matter of Conservatism and Liberalism. The reason I mentioned these ideals in the first place is because this is how the usual argument plays off. I can counter your statement with a conservative point and it would be neutralized, and then you can put forward another liberal viewpoint and it will go on. However, Islamic governance or Islam in general is not part of that spectrum. The position of Islam in the spectrum is perceived as being conservative in the modern day, however it does not lie in the same category at all. This is why I mentioned that there must be a balance between conservatism and liberalism. That is the way forward and Islam has always facilitated that. Islam gives freedom for adapting and innovating in certain fields while it also lays down a solid foundation for people to stand.

> I wasn't arguing that Islam would be equally powerful, influential or complete under a secular model. My assertion suggested that Muslims would enjoy their basic human rights. The preservation of Islamic power is a different issue altogether. 

Sure, I agree. But the basic human rights for all members of Pakistan is preserved under Islamic rule as well. There are strict rulings on the protection and autonomy of minorities and non-Muslims in Islam. If people fail to implement them, you can't blame Islam. Because if you don't solve the root of the problem, which is education, then switching to secularism won't solve anything. I mean, just look at India. 

> I do accept the premise that a secular state would undermine Islamic power to some degree. But you're not proving why that's necessarily a moral wrong. You have to actually compare the tangible consequences and benefits of absolute Islamic power. You're assuming that a secularist would see the undermining of Islamic influence as a harm in and of itself. 

If you don't consider undermining Islam as a moral wrong, and need ""tangible"" consequences for it to be considered immoral, then you are speaking of something similar to Utilitarianism. And going down that path is a slippery slope.  Essentially your argument becomes that the ends justify the means. 

Islam provides objective morals. It is unchanging and uncompromising and in that sense it gives it inherent value because it was the same thousands of years ago and will be the same thousands of years in the future. For a person who doesn't follow Islam, their morals are entirely subjective. Like you just mentioned ""tangible consequences"" as a prerequisite for undermining Islam, but for Muslims, the simple act of undermining Islam is the most immoral thing you can do. I'm not assuming the secularists would see it that way, but I'm telling you it is undeniably immoral for Muslims to do such a thing. So you can't expect Muslims to simply be okay with secularism. That is my point. 

> Your point about the general Pakistani not wanting a secular state is a truistic one. Like, yes, you're right, but this can't be a reason to denounce the benefits of a secular state. This just becomes an appeal to popular opinion. Ofc secularization won't happen in present day Pakistan. It'd only happen if there was significant support for it. I think the point of the discussion is to argue about whether we should work towards that goal or not. 

Yes I agree that the appeal to popular opinion is not a solid argument when it comes to proving something, however, in the realm of democracy, it is. The main reason I mentioned the popular opinion is that if you really want secularism, you would be going against the will and wishes of the majority of Pakistanis. And I mean an overwhelming majority. 

I want to be clear. In my entire argument, I don't see secularism as an ideal as being inherently wrong in terms of governance. But secularism is simply an ""alternative"". And I emphasize the world ""alternative"" because it is not something better or worse, just a different form of governance. It may solve a few issues but will bring issues of its own. Every single one of the problems Pakistan faces can be solved by staying an Islamic republic or even by becoming a fully Islamic state. Secularism is simply not necessary.",8,1,1590665060.0

If someone genuinely holds hateful views for our war veterans, then I will agree with you on that.

However, if we are talking about the events from the last few days, after Imran Khan was abducted, those statues and pictures ceased to signify the bravery of our martyrs. 

They were targeted because, for the ordinary man, in the heat of the moment, they symbolized markers of an oppressive force that has repeatedly intervened to create problems for the common man.

They saw symbols of the military establishment. They targeted them in anger. That's it. 

>By your logic, if Pervez Elahi or Jehangir Tareen are corrupt, all of people in PTI must also be corrupt.

Two fallacies. 

False equivalence and Strawman. 

(1) Pervez Elahi and Jehangir Tareen don't have total command over PTI. 

The military has a chain of command. You have to obey what your senior tells you. Therefore, in effect, the military does exactly what Asim Munir tells it to. The Army Chief can mold the military however he wishes to.

(2) I never said that the entire military is corrupt so I am not even sure where that came from. 

The average PTI supporter has far greater respect for our martyrs than the others anyway. 

It's not a coincidence that most military families stand with PTI as well.

It's the betrayal by the military leadership that has provoked all the anger. We loved them. We trusted them. We honored them.. and they stabbed us in the back.",5,11,1684095095.0

iba5amc,t3_v5jbyi,"Pakistan got independence in 1947

Pakistan lost independence in 1958

East Pakistan Realized this problem the hard way and fought back fiercely and became independent in 1971

West Pakistan remain under military dictatorship that has puppet government to keep people distracted from this reality so that they don't revolt. I would say they are the most genius dictatorship ever to exist in history of the world. Probably because they learned from their mistakes in East Pakistan and became too subtle for ordinary people to notice. We are oppressed by the same force, just that they became smarter and bigger.

Just to clarify, we are not talking about the ordinary soldiers here. Not even officers. We are talking about the top most three rank layers of the Army. They are the beneficiaries of this system.

Ordinary soldiers and officers are just ordinary people like us, who just take orders from the top and does their job. They are good people who protect us, but we are talking about those who have houses in London, or business chains in America. They take advantage of the Martyrdom of brave soldiers and market it to the Awaam while behind the scene making billions in corrupt money.

No matter which govt comes, they all are Army's puppets. They exist as an illusion of choice. Sure, Imran Khan may have good intentions, but he himself has admitted that he did not have full power and he too have to work as a puppet. And as we all saw, he was replaced. The current govt is also puppet, but now more people realize it now.

And I bet they will bring Imran Khan again next year or whenever we start protesting big against current govt. This is all just a distraction to keep the public under control. And unless Imran Khan uses his popularity to properly expose this system, there is no way out other than a full on revolution.

Currently entire Pakistan exists as a business venture that makes them consistent profits, which they save up in foreign countries as they don't like the quality of life here. For them, Pakistan is just their temporary house you take on rent near your office. They only care enough to keep their business protected. They will do anything to protect their profits just like East India company.

Now there is a slim chance this could change. Currently, the prices of everything is rising. This will affect a large enough population to rise up and see the full picture. This is the biggest threat to Dictatorships.

Due to a shrinking Economy, the Army is finding it increasingly difficult to make as much corruption money as they used to. Their illegal business profits are also down. Thus you will see cracks appearing as it become difficult for them to keep their own people in control due to lesser and lesser corruption money to divide.

We all need to understand that it is not just Bajwa. You see, you cannot have a dictatorship with just you as a king. You need a system of people to work for you. And you have to pay them to keep them loyal to you. And, they are not expecting ""salaries"" but instead billions in corrupt money. So, when they see their money decrease, they may start fighting or throwing a tantrum.

And due to recent political circumstances, it is possible that people may get a chance to fight and change such the regime. Ask yourself - Is this what so many freedom fighters including Jinnah fought hard for?

You all are educated, atleast enough to read English. Many of you are even in foreign countries in powerful positions. It is your duty to spread the truth and inform other citizens about these issues as many are unfortunately not educated enough to research and understand all of these. You can do however you want. Tell your friends, make memes like this, make videos, write if you can, put it in whatsapp groups etc.

I've only recently started following current affairs since IK's ousting but have always heard about this shadowy establishment since early childhood. I'm more of an idealist and in a way naive too, but I won't stop dreaming about the good things our country can become.

As for the video, it ""should"" be similar to whistle blowing documentaries that are hard to swallow eye openers as they are the best mediums in the recent day and age to allow the masses to wake up. 

In the larger picture, I believe it's all down to Allah's plan when truth will reign over falsehood but I'm definitely sure it will come out of common people as vessels rather than a miraculous overnight shift. 

Regarding how the video should be, I believe it should start from the beginning, i.e. the creation of Pakistan and should cover the eras of each leader and what they added to/subtracted from the equation. Should be done in episodes, with citations, references and interviews of whoever can contribute to/reinforce the narrative.

fuvqnfd,t1_fuvq2ov,"Whilst the Crown frequently refers to the monarch, this reference is to the monarch in his or her capacity as monarch, and does not refer to that individual in his or her totality of ownership interests and actions. The monarch can act in an official capacity (as the Crown) and in a private capacity. This duality of characterization can be illustrated in several ways. In property ownership for example, although both are royal residences, Buckingham Palace is the property of the Crown via the Crown Estate (an organ of government) whilst Balmoral Castle is the property of Elizabeth II personally, and not of the Crown. The latter property can be freely alienated by the Queen, whereas any disposition of the former property would need to be done via the instrument of government as an act of state. Similarly, the Queen's bank accounts at Coutts (a private entity, albeit whose parent entity, Royal Bank of Scotland, is coincidentally majority-owned by the state as a result of a bail-out of the bank during the financial crisis of 2007–2008) contain components of her private wealth only, whilst the resources of the monarch acting as the Crown are dispensed from HM Treasury and the Crown Estate to the Royal Household. A third example is in employment relationships; Elizabeth II can use her private resources to employ persons to run her private affairs (even if in practice it is likely that her private enterprises such as the Balmoral and Sandringham estates are structured as companies, which as entities with separate legal personality in Scots and English law would be the true hirer of an employee, which makes this unlikely in practice). However, those who assist as employees of the monarch as the Crown (e.g. the staff at Buckingham Palace) do so on employment from the Royal Household, the official department charged with supporting the monarch. Those who are directly appointed to official positions by the monarch (commissions in the Army, judges of the courts of England and Wales, governors of Canadian provinces to take discrete examples) form a third category, where the Crown as monarch begins to blend into the Crown as the state. Strictly speaking, government officials are for the service of the monarch acting officially, whilst she might hire private advocates to pursue actions in her private life. Thus the monarch's main lawyer as to English law is the government's lawyer, the Attorney General, but in her private capacity, she instructs Farrer & Co, an independent law firm.

Note that whilst there is a distinction between the monarch's two capacities, official and private, there is an exception to this rule, where there is unity of capacities; this being the style and form of address of the monarch. As described in *MacCormick v Lord Advocate*, amongst the royal prerogatives is the right and authority of the monarch to style themselves, and command others to so style them, with such combination of name and regnal number as they wish (thus Albert, Duke of York designated himself George VI on his accession to the throne). Accompanying this style is the form of address of the monarch. This varies across commonwealth realms, but in all is the monarch addressed as ""Your Majesty"". This royal prerogative, and the various Letters Patent which buttress it, derive entirely from the monarch acting or existing in an official capacity. However it is also transcribed over into the monarch's private sphere as well: Elizabeth II is never correctly referred to as Elizabeth Windsor in any capacity.

The Crown, when referencing the monarch as opposed to the state, can only refer to the monarch alone. It does not refer to any other member of the Royal Family, though such royals typically represent the Crown in engagements, and hold (usually ceremonial) Crown positions. In this manner they are agents and servants of the Crown in similar manner to ministers, judges, soldiers, and civil servants.

Had to set everything on easy and hope for the best. But man I'm just floored by it. it's amazing what they have achieved on a technical level. If one has the system and can get through the download they should definitely try it out. Magic.,1,18,1598354964.0
g2sh2mo,t1_g2sflnx,"Yeah sure. I'm not very PC savvy. I primarily game on my Xbox but I'll try answering the best I can. My PC has an RTX 2060 and a 3700x and I'm playing at 1440p all settings set to high with TAA (saw on a digital foundry video that ultra doesn't do much other than melt stuff). Vsync is off, capped the fps to 30 or atleast tried to in the settings; read that the game runs uncapped regardless which they might fix with an update so I'm not sure about this. Everything worked fine and looked great. There were menial hiccups here and there after extended playtime (2-3 hours in) but otherwise and even then it worked swell. Loading times aren't ideal, they're not bad perse but they're not amazing either. On the subject of the internet. Firstly the game download is 130 GB, took me days to download. As you probably know the game fetches satellite data on the fly I was working with a 20mb consistent connection (not Ptcl lol) absolutely no issues at all with that but yes I could tell that I was above the bare minimum with the internet speed. Don't think one could run this on a 8/10mb inconsistent connection without issues. Hope this helped.",1,27,1598356105.0
g2shpsh,t1_g2shdo8,"I actually switched out the mouse for the controller. The keyboard you still have to use in tandem as the game has way too many inputs.

You should see what went on in Karachi during Nawaz's time in 90's before Musharraf, People were being picked up house to house and killed in many areas (by army men).

The second time the crackdowns happened was during downfall of MQM, they were pretty bad too though not as bad as the first time. It was during this time the rangers were there to mainly conduct operations and crackdowns especially in areas like Nine-Zero.

The only problem the second time was that Taliban were also having fun in Karachi as well so people kind of had to still rely on one side.

j834i0f,t1_j82w0bu,"(Note: I am not defending MQM crimes or anything here)

The answer may vary depending on who you ask, according to what I have heard from our elders is that there was a tension between Mahajirs and others. This started to go in a worse direction since Bhutto's Quota system.

After MQM was formed it ""advocated"" for rights of Mahajirs, it gained a large support over the years. This made the then ruling parties (PMLN, PPP) feel ""threatened"", as MQM was gaining momentum across many places.

So operations were started against MQM and to an extent against Mahajirs to quell down the ""threat"" to both dynastical families (that were already at each other's throats). Hyderabad and Karachi suffered the most in these operations.

As a result more people rallied behind MQM against PPP and PMLN and the hatred still remains in many to this day. But this is just my perspective. There may be other sides as well. 

As for the second phase it was under Nawaz's term (again) to quell MQM in Karachi and well... he succeeded but het got kicked out of power thankfully soon after but the city was still under surveillance by rangers and armed forces (because TTP), which went up until 2017.

It was more than sectarian, to simplify it big men in power did not wanted to lose their hold so they took all measures to quell the opposition (like they are trying with PTI right now)",7,2,1676100328.0
itimfjg,t3_ybue7r,"Arshad Sharif’s father Muhammad Sharif was a commander in the Pakistan Navy. He was awarded the Medal of Distinction for his bravery and services. He died of a heart attack in 2011. Arshad’s brother Major Ashraf Sharif was stationed in Bannu at that time. Upon hearing the news of his father’s death, he left Bannu Cantt and was on his way to the funeral but his car drowned as it was attacked by the banned TTP. 

Major Ashraf Sharif was martyred in this attack. He was only 35 years old.

On the one hand, while the preparations for the funeral of Arshad Sharif’s father were going on, the news of his brother’s martyrdom also came, after which two funerals took place on the same day from the same house.

Arshad Sharif was living in exile and was one of the finest investigative journalist.

He recently reported on the FIA Shehbaz Sharif case and the murder of Dr. Rizwan. He always conducted thorough investigation and presented people with tangible proof of corruption.

He went into self-exile and launched a YouTube channel. He was passionate about his job his upcoming TV show was about to go on air on BOL TV.

ARY didn't stand with him when they got pressurised from establishment to remove him from channel.

He wasn't willing to go abroad but his family forced him to go as there were serious death threats about him.

He was shot in the head while he was travelling in the car in Kenya according to the latest news reports.

This was a well-executed assassination since the Kenyan police are known as the ""death squad"" because clients from other countries hire them to kill the targets they desire, and four foreigners have recently been murdered in Kenya in this manner.

He might have travelled to Kenya to visit his investigative journalist [friend](https://imgur.com/a/o5U0rJT) there with whom he was collaborating on the documentary ""behind closed doors.""

Im sure he named names making Bajwa and PDM very uncomfortable. Waiting for the documentary to ge released. 

There is a concerted attack from all side on Pakistan, its boundaries, it's religious and cultural identity and men like Arshad Sharif, Imran Riaz Khan, Arshad bhatti are men who refuse to sell out. There is a high cost for standing up for Pakistan. Today we lost another son of Pakistan.

fq9xtg0,t1_fq9rwhp,"Ambedkar was in favour of a plebiscite, distinguishing between Jammu and the Valley. And yeah, there is a scary possibility (to Indians) that Kashmir would have chosen to secede.

In truth this issue has gone on so long that the problem has festered like an open sore. Relatively very few Kashmiris lived pre-independence, and as such have lived the majority of their lives on opposite sides of their border. 

I don't know how happy the citizens of POK (don't hate pls, you may call it whatever you want) are, but I know that Indian Kashmiris... Definitely have a fair degree of mistrust towards India. The fact of the matter is that both governments have treated Kashmir as a piece of real estate with extreme strategic value, and the people themselves have been treated as expendable.

It's unfortunate, because if the Kashmiris had not engaged in militancy and the Armed Forces had not cracked down so brutally at various times (and both those factors are essentially the faults of governments), at this point the people of the region would have probably integrated far better with the rest of India. Article 370 has anyway been greatly diluted over the years, and is more of a right wing talking point than any real source of friction between Kashmiris and other Indians. 

In any case, as an Indian, I personally hope that within our lifetimes, Indians and Pakistanis liberate ourselves from our pseudo-theocratic overlords and manage to find a bilateral solution to the Kashmir problem that prioritises the Kashmiri people, who are at least in my opinion the only ones whose opinions ought to really matter here.

Because hopefully after that India and Pakistan will be able to achieve the close diplomatic ties that are frankly a no-brainer, and to cooperate against the real threat of this century, China.

fqaarcr,t1_fq9xtg0,"Your entire comment is just attempting to shift a lot of the blame onto the Kashmiris and then put Pakistan and India on equal footing as to their treatment of Kashmir.

Firstly, the Kashmiris *responded* with violence because of India's actions. India directly interfered with their elections and peaceful protests got them nowhere. When they revolted, India thought it could quash them with its army. 

Jammu is only Hindu majority because the Muslims were genocided by Dogra fanatics, so I personally don't support drawing a distinction between there and the Valley. 

Secondly, do watch YouTube videos of AJK/Pak-administered Kashmir to get an actual view of what happens there. Indians always call it ""POK"" which is quite astonishing given that, as I'm sure you know, the residents of that region want nothing to do with you. The Kashmiris of IoJK already want nothing to do with you. 

Maybe calling it ""POK"" is a coping tactic but just be honest with yourself. There's the Indian narrative, and then there's reality. Speak to a Gilgiti, Mirpuri or Kashmiri in real life and tell them they're just Indians who are occupied by Pakistan, you'll find out if what you've been fed all these years is true. 

You said you want a solution prioritise Kashmiris yet stop short of supporting a referendum. A referendum is the only *peaceful* solution and it's many decades overdue, courtesy of India as usual. 


I don't know where you got this Indo-Pak anti-China alliance idea from but I wouldn't be in support of it because it wouldn't work, given the small issue that Indians have been brainwashed into hating us. Plus India wants to be a regional hegemon so it wouldn't be very beneficial to Pakistan anyway. I'd rather just pit the two against each other. 

I'm also not in support of close relations with India, we can see how it treats Nepal and Bangladesh. No thank you. If Kashmir is liberated from India, then I would support minimal trade relations initially, that's it. If China is the threat of this century, then India would be the threat of the next. I see no reason to trust it or assist it in its goal of becoming regional hegemon.

Tl;Dr: stop blaming the Kashmiris, Pak and India are not equal in treatment of Kashmir, a referendum is the only peaceful solution but India refuses to hold one (and likely never will) and a close alliance with India is implausible and foolish.",2,41,1589215841.0
fqd5otd,t1_fq9xtg0,"There is no comparison between how India treats Kashmiris and how Pakistanis treat them. Not only does the Indian state brutally oppress Kashmiris, the Indian society gaslights and harbours active fantasies of raping Kashmiri women.
You won’t find both of those happening in Pakistan. 

Kashmiris engaged in militancy precisely because of the suppression of their right and denial of their voice in elections. They wouldn’t have integrated because they never signed up for India in the first place; the Maharaja did by deceit but the society never did.  Which is why you have the conflict in the first place.

But it seems like no discussion is worthwhile. Indian society dehumanises Kashmiris as terrorists and harbours rape fantasies whereas Indian state is clearly going to conduct ethnic cleansing of Kashmiris.

For someone already suffering in Pakistan it'd probably be a dream come true to be able to afford a decent blue collar job, but for the life of me I don't get why anyone who isn't rich enough to live well anywhere in the world they choose, in which case it doesn't matter where they live, would move here. It's a shitshow. Maybe in the 90's. Not anymore. It's just FOMO from that one uncle or cousin or aunt who 'got out'.",0,19,1644073403.0

Anyone else who wants to look up crime stats avoid the site numbeo. It was the first one I looked at (cuz it’s high on Google), but then it turns out their methodology is entirely how visitors felt about going to the city and then went onto the website and self-reported.

Edit: something just popped in my head. I will admit I don’t know how the Lahore murder number I found was obtained. So it could be iffy there since I’m not sure about the agency that does that.

So Jinnah's vision was for a state of educated Muslims being run secularly (I.E. a defined division between state and Islamic Shari'ah in the way of the post-Tanzimat Devlet-e-Osmaniye, unlike the post-Aurangzeb Gurkhani Sultanat) but with a Muslim-majority state so that it would protect the rights and privileges of Indian Muslims while respecting the rights and privileges of religious minorities.",8,1,1582725340.0

The Ahamdi/Qadiani belief clearly goes against it and the reason Muslims are against it because in Judism and Christianity they added and subtracted from the word of God whatever was of benefit to them and whatever they deemed ""too strict"" they left it out. And look what happens when you replace the word of God with the word of man, It loses it's spiritual value and doesn't effect the heart of men anymore. As it is evident from the fact that there are so many different versions of bibles and each and every one of them contradict each other and some are omitting one thing and some are others. And this has led to people in western countries leave their religion because they all believe that it is ""man made myth"" etc. 


If we allow this addition and subtraction to fit people's ""wishes"" in Islam then it will inevitably lead down to the same path. You should also know this that Ahamdi/Qadiani belief isn't a ""sect"" of Islam, it wholly and completely goes against one of the fundamentals in Islam which is the finality of Prophethood. 


Therefore in constitution of Pakistan after a lot of debate and extensive research from prominent scholars representing each sect have come to conclusion that Ahamdis/Qadiani cannot be called as Muslims and their place of worship cannot be called a Mosque.

This effectively turns them into non-Muslim minority but this doesn't mean they are second rate citizens without any rights. They have equal rights as Pakistani citizens just like any other non-Muslim religion. And it is wrong to attack their place of worship.

Khatam does not mean last. If Hazoor (saw) is Khataman Nabiyeen, means that the Quran is also Khatam al Kutub. Does that mean that there are no books after the Quran, or no new Religious scriptures after the Quran?

Also Khatam has many meaning, it can be also used to show the rank of someone (ie. Praise someone). Hazrat Ali (ra) was known as Khatam-ul-Auliya. Hazrat Isa (as) was known as Khatam-ul-A'immah etc etc.

It is even reported in Hadiths that Hazoor (saw) stated ""I was Seal of the Prophets (Khataman Nabiyeen) even when Adam was in the elementary stages of his development"" (Mishkat Al Masabih, Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal, Kanzul Ummal, Kitabul Fitan)

> since they claim there was a Prophet after Muhammad (saw)

No it doesn't. Hazoor (saw) prophesied of a latter-day Messiah and even called him a Nabiyullah 4 times (Sahih Muslim 2937a, not to mention that it also states that latter-day Hazrat Isa (as) would descend directly east of Damascus)! It does not!

Lets say there is a person who hasn't got a medical degree, but calls himself a doctor. Does he become a doctor? Is the definition of a doctor changed? Do people who call him out on it (judge him) are wrong and shouldn't judge him because they don't have Ilm-ul-ghaib? 

Everything is not Ilm-ul-ghaib.  Sure, only Allah knows what is in a person's heart but that doesn't mean the definition of a Muslim gets distorted. A person who doesn't believe in the finality of prophethood is not a Muslim whatever he may want to call himself, and it doesn't matter if he has declared this or has kept it hidden in his heart. There are numerous ahadith warning about false prophets and that whoever follows them is not a Muslim. There is a hadith which very clearly states that (the mafhoom) there will not be any prophet after Hazrat Muhammad (Peace be upon Him). Have you heard of Musaylmah Kazzab? How did the Sahaba deal with him? Did they say that only Allah knows what is in his heart so let him be? No? 

Mirza Qadiyani claimed prophethood, which makes his followers non-muslims, as they've pretty clearly ignored a very basic tenet of the Islamic core beliefs.

Title: 9 Types of Pakistanis on Social Media - Which One Are You?

1.	The ""Mashallah"" Auntie: Always commenting ""Mashallah"" on every post, even if it's not relevant. They're known for their endless blessings and love for cute babies.

3.	The ""Desi Ghee"" Chef: Always sharing mouthwatering pictures of their homemade desi ghee delicacies. Their secret ingredient is always desi ghee.
4.	The ""Haw Haye"" Drama Fanatic: Always posting about the latest Pakistani dramas and swooning over the romantic scenes. Their heart skips a beat at the sight of Fawad Khan.
5.	The ""Biryani is Life"" Foodie: Always on the hunt for the perfect biryani. They judge restaurants based on the quality of their biryani and will travel far and wide to find the best one.
6.	The ""Mujhe Kyun Nikala"" Politician: Always blaming their political opponents for their problems. They're quick to play the victim and will use any opportunity to criticize the government.
7.	The ""Lambi Choti"" Hair Expert: Always sharing tips and tricks for long, luscious hair. They swear by their homemade remedies and will try anything to get Rapunzel-like locks.
8.	The ""Haye Allah"" Romantic: Always posting about their significant other and how much they love them. Their social media is filled with love letters and romantic gestures.
9.	The ""Influencer"" Wannabe: Always posing for the camera and using hashtags like #OOTD and #InstaGood. They're trying to become the next big thing on social media and will do whatever it takes to gain followers.",0,32,1682950206.0

Our liberal people have been fuxxed up for a long time. They have been hypocritical.

First it was just KGB propaganda being funneled through PPP that created a whole generation of desi ""liberals"" and ""socialists"". These  old boomers would talk about Roti Kapra Makaan while supporting feudalism and trying to impose  authoritarianism themselves by having those socialism wet dreams.

Now we have liberals who denigrate every aspect of Pakistan whether it is bad or not. They'll blame EVERY problem on religion. Poverty, corruption, lack of education, health facilities, mortality rate, slow economic growth whatever. To these idiots everything's due to religion.

I recently had had some neo-liberal mfs telling me about how Mustafa Kamal was such a great liberal. I told them that he was  an authoritarian leader who never got elected and ruled as a dictator with a military background, killed thousands of innocent Kurds, bombed their villages, forced minorities to Turkify themselves and banned azaan, quran and traditional Turkic clothing like Fez. I pointed out that all these are contrary to liberal ideas of democracy, free will and tolerance but these idiots were happy that he was an enemy of religion and that was enough for them to worship him.

Same with many prominent neo-liberals like Syed Muzammil and others. They'll generalize the whole mass of Pakistani men as rapists and such. Isn't that a logical fallacy?? They talk all day about philosophy, the art of arguments and logical fallacies but will do the same mistakes.

I am not saying that the same hypocrisies cannot be seen among religious people. I for one do not associate with any Pakistani religious faction or group. But we Pakistanis have a habit of betraying our principles a lot. Whether its the politician, military, liberals, conservatives, feminists whatever. That's why these groups call each other pseudo \[insert\]",3,2,1683309529.0

America's melting-pot structure reduces the radicalness of most Muslims who end up there. Canada is more of a salad bowl where different demographics get to preserve bits of their heritage, but also co-interact with other cultures peacefully, so Canadian Pakis are still pretty chill for the most part.

The UK is f\*\*\*ed because that place straight-up let every village Paki in 1970s and 1980s in, and they ended up building enclaves where people cling to (and push) religion as a distinct part of their identity. I don't agree with the incredibly racist/myopic viewpoints that British groups like EDL bring up, but some of their concerns about the problematic practices British Paki families engage in are absolutely valid and deserve proper attention.",4,6,1682971143.0
jiqh1gc,t1_jip511r,"Starting off with the wannabe “Arab”. Dresses and acts like one with his broken accent and probably drives what every other blue collar expat or average expat drives in the Gulf. Is often called out by people but his ego issues are sky high. 

Next is the Pakistani, who probably hasn’t visited Pakistan in over 10 or 15 years due to God knows what reason. (my dads case). 

Followed by people who have third or fourth generation of their family well settled in the Gulf. These are likely educated folks or have a business of some sort. Another thing is if they’re well educated, chances are these people are probably fluent with Arabic and in some cases hard to differentiate whether they’re a citizen (depends on the respective country) or an expat. 

And as always there’s PML(N) supporters. Speaking from experience, PML(N) supporters are living and doing well for themselves in Kuwait. Pretty stable job and good payment. Some have their families living with them too while most live alone. Of course they’re called “patwaris” too.

And of course you’ll find people who behave like they’re from their village and live life as if their father has a strong feudal system like in Pakistan. These are the worst breeds of Pakistanis here in the Gulf. 

And the list goes on. Can’t remember of any other specific stereotypes but dramatic “PHAPPA KHUTTAN” aunties exist here as well. Many Pakistanis are toxic and often look for opportunities to rip somebody off or scam them (Yeah I’m looking at you, Young gen Pakistanis)",4,2,1683141313.0

He was just grasping onto straws in order to convince others that IK was the worst things to happen to Pakistan. After every 3 or 4 sentences he would repeat that he was not a Zardari or Sharif supporter.

Near the end of the 'conversation', he inadvertently repeated some 2 or 3 PML-N Twitter talking points. When asked about that he became emotional about his love for Nawaz Sharif and N-league. Since he had mentioned his dad as a reference multiple times for his views and criticisms I asked him about him as well. He refused to talk further.

A google search revealed that his dad was a political appointee in the bureaucracy during PPP's tenure and laer on was investigated for flouting rules and suspected of being an accomplice to some corruption scandal.

fwkz7sf,t1_fwkfsr1,"> I have never supported any political party. So far in the history of Pakistan, this is the MOST incompetent government ever. 

Wrong, the most incompetent government is PPP, and PMLN was the government using artificial and unsustainable means to keep our economy artificially afloat through utilising forex reserves alongside loans. This was leading us to a path where we would have gone bankrupt/defaulted.

>  Such a downfall in the economy has never been faced by our country, under the reign of any other government or military leader. 

Firstly, before explaining our economic situation I'll explain how this isn't the worst economy we've ever had. [Crime under Zardari was higher](https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/PAK/pakistan/crime-rate-statistics). Also [inflation skyrocketed under Zardari](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/inflation-cpi). Inflation is nowhere near as bad as you claim it is. So kindly stop parroting false information. It's currently at 8% which is drastically lesser than PPP or previous years.

> Previous governments WERE corrupt, but always had ""somewhat substantial"" progress they could flex and show to the people. This government sadly, has ""almost none"". All previous governments have held their fair share of hypocrisy. This government has descended to lowest standards in hypocrisy. It aches me to see my country in this state 

Let me quickly disprove this notion without getting too into specifics.

Firstly, what you have to realise is how under PMLN (I'm only talking about PMLN because you seriously cannot believe PPP was any better than PTI. They've done nothing for Sindh and their governance has always destroyed Pakistan back since Bhutto himself) it seems that poverty and whatnot got any better. But Nawaz Sharif was following a completely backward economic policy, which would have literally led to Pakistan going bankrupt. So I don't know why you would prefer those short-term benefits.

Nawaz Sharif took in massive loans, mortgaged off government properties and used forex reserves to artificially overvalue the rupee. During his time we saw the exports, trade deficits skyrocket. Under him we were literally living under a sweet illusion, which would have never lasted. Pakistan was on the road to bankruptcy.

When Imran Khan came into power he undid all of that, he immediately called for further taxation. Exposed the crummy practices being done. He had to undo all of the past mistakes, which is why the rupees value was revealed and we face this economic prolapse. Here’s how much the situation has improved under Imran Khan.

Asides from the increasing taxes, he has made it a policy to reduce our trade deficit which had spiked under Nawaz Sharif and again was unsustainable. Take a look at our trade deficit [and how much it's reduced under PTI/IK](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/balance-of-trade).

To further emphasize this, [take a look at Pakistan's exports under NS and then under IK](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/exports). The intense focus on increasing exports is what's resulted in the massive decrease in our trade deficit, and is vital for reviving what was becoming of our economy. [You see Pakistan actually recording profits instead of absolute deficits now as well thanks to the reduction in imports and the improved trade balance.](https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2020/06/25/current-account-records-surplus-of-13m-in-may/)

To illustrate on what Nawaz Sharif was doing, [take a look at this foreign exchange graph](https://tradingeconomics.com/pakistan/foreign-exchange-reserves). The increase under the PMLN government is solidified proof of just how many loans he had taken, and the path of destruction we were headed on.

[We're now seeing our trade deficit contracting to $15b under Imran Khan](https://tribune.com.pk/story/2168222/2-pakistans-trade-deficit-contracts-27-15-7b#:~:text=Overall%2C%20the%20trade%20deficit%2C%20which,period%20of%20current%20fiscal%20year.&text=Eight%2Dmonth%20exports%20were%20equal,the%20target%20of%20%2451.7%20billion).

In short, your claims of the government having done nothing are the furthest from the truth, it has quite literally saved us from bankrupcy and imploding. If it wasn't for these drastic reforms which are already seeing massive benefits, [where even the FBR reported profits from tax despite COVID](https://arynews.tv/en/covid-19-fbr-tax-collection-target/), we would be doomed.

Please, understand that the short-term economic policy under PML-N was completely incompetent, and was leading us to a massive pit of despair, which has been turned around by PTI. If it wasn't for covid we'd have been economically way better off by 2023, but currently everything is on hold thanks to Covid, the entire world economy has contracted, so it is inevitable.",1,14,1593611048.0

(edit: this became way longer than I thought bc I just kinda unloaded everything here. I'd appreciate if anyone read and has something to say bc I want as much feedback as possible <3)

or at least I used to be I guess. I lived a pretty comfortable life in Pakistan and I was basically a weaboo for America, since a lot of my family lives there and I was obsessed with pop culture and all that superficial shit. I've just now found out what a burger is and almost everything checks the boxes for me. I moved to America a couple years ago and over the years I've come to realize what a fucking idiot I used to be. I used to always try to speak American English and thought I was cool for doing so. I speak English fluently now in an almost perfect American accent, and being in America that's a huge advantage, but now my Urdu is broken af. tbf that's not completely my fault, as I haven't taken an Urdu course since I was in fourth grade, and I couldn't write a paragraph with prefect spelling if I had to. Moving to America and seeing the polarization in religion, economic inequality, culture, and politics in general has made me hyperaware of what I used to be. I look back at my old self with disgust, as its everything I resent. I try to speak Urdu all the time, never in the house or with my family. I'm going to try to read more Urdu literature, as I've been working on reading Urdu for a while and I can definitely say ive improved my reading. Although it is difficult for me to complete a long conversation in Urdu without saying at least a couple words in English. I guess coming to America has been both a blessing and a curse, as I'm now a much better person and am aware of my privilege, even if I don't live as comfortably as I did in Pakistan, but now I've become severely detached from my cousins in Pakistan, who grew up in their own environment, not having any connections to America, and there's a strong cultural divide I feel whenever I talk to them. I guess that was the biggest thing that made me realize my idiocy. If I had continued to live in Pakistan I might have still been close to my cousins and family but I would still just have been a burger asshole, but now that I'm here and have somewhat experienced a relatively upper-middle class lifestyle that's not as comfortable in some ways as in Pakistan, and seen what America really is outside of the superficial pop-culture consumerist bullshit, I've now just become very detached from whom I consider the closest people to me. I know OP's post was kind of just a shitpost meme, but I have family that pretty much lives in a house identical to that in Lahore, and seeing stuff like that reminds me of the severe alienation I feel from my literal home country.",0,11,1609696339.0

ghzteas,t1_ghypyk5,"it's just a term to 'other' people and it's very inconsistent. burger is a catch all term for 'westernized'/'liberal', and that keeps shifting. It originally was making fun of people who called 'bun kababs', 'burgers'. Even though bun kabab places name themselves burger places often enough for it to be interchangeable. Now it ranges from anyone who speaks English better than Urdu, even if their Urdu is perfectly fine, to gatekeeping real Pakistani-ness, to dismiss a demographic as not representative because projecting class anxiety/punching up/pushing at outsiders is okay. 

Growing up at the edge of a kachi abaadi i saw it used mostly on Christians who spoke English well to exclude them, or the old money kids who still spoke english well enough but lived in a tiny two bedroom apartment and were struggling, or visiting 2nd generation Pakistanis, most of whom spoke Urdu better than locals because their parents made a concerted effort to teach them their culture. 10 to 20 years ago it was someone who wore pants and shirts to Friday prayers, or the boys who didn't swear as much and play grab ass or run around on motorbikes without a license since they were underage. Those guys didn't get as much attention from the girls because peppering every conversation with MC / BC not using deodorant puts people off, and it was hard to take a chance dating someone who was running wild back when dating could still be a massive taboo.

For me it was when I started reading more english books at the corner dhaaba/park, because they were easier to get in the topics I liked outside of pulp fiction/magazines. Other kids felt excluded, so they gradually stopped talking to me except to make fun of spending my time reading, and the kapra my mom told me to use to lie down on the grass because she didn't want me to get grass stains and mud on my clothes so we wouldn't waste water. I met some of them years later, speaking fluent English mostly, and no problems with me otherwise.

I hate the way the Bangladesh was treated, I dislike the blasphemy laws, I think the treatment of LGBT and women needs to much better than it is, and Pakistan has had a very shaky history with democracy and there is a very real disparity in wealth with elites looting the nation. I’m also not a fan of religion in government and find that a lot of cultural practices like treatment of those with mental health issues needs to go. 

The point though is that I still see the good side. A lot of Pakistanis are protesting the corruption in government, a lot of Pakistanis are demanding better rights, a lot of Pakistanis are willing to stand up for minorities like Christians and Hindus and Aurat March was cool because it showed that there are even those seeing that conditions for women need to to improve. I still appreciate the history that stretches all the way back to the Indus River Valley, I still understand a lot of Pakistan’s issues come from colonialism, and I still wanna see the nation get better.

The only thing is, it seems that you wish for Pakistan to become secular and then also adopt other liberal ideas (I'm assuming things like same sex marriage, etc). The issue with this is that it goes outside the political overton window of Pakistan, to the point where any leader who attempts to secularize Pakistan would be seen as a traitor, be overthrown, and be executed. How Pakistanis see secularists isn't that different from how Americans see Muslims that want sharia enforced in the US. So what you want Pakistan to ""improve"" towards is something almost no one wants.

Nobody ever said that Pakistan's sole purpose was creating an Islamic state that upholds Shariah Law.

hjgq3he,t1_hjc8flk,"Greeting the kuffaar on Christmas and other religious holidays of theirs is haraam, by consensus, as Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah: ""Congratulating the kuffaar on the rituals that belong only to them is haraam by consensus, as is congratulating them on their festivals and fasts by saying ‘A happy festival to you’ or ‘May you enjoy your festival,’ and so on. If the one who says this has been saved from kufr, it is still forbidden. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the cross, or even worse than that. It is as great a sin as congratulating someone for drinking wine, or murdering someone, or having illicit sexual relations, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their religion fall into this error; they do not realize the offensiveness of their actions. Whoever congratulates a person for his disobedience or bid’ah or kufr exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allaah.""  
  
Congratulating the kuffaar on their religious festivals is haraam to the extent described by Ibn al-Qayyim because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of kufr, even if one would not accept those things for oneself. But the Muslim should not aceept the rituals of kufr or congratulate anyone else for them, because Allaah does not accept any of that at all, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
""If you disbelieve, then verily, Allaah is not in need of you, He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you. . ."" \[al-Zumar 39:7\]  
"". . . This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion . . ."" \[al-Maa’idah 5:3\]  
So congratulating them is forbidden, whether they are one’s colleagues at work or otherwise.  
If they greet us on the occasion of their festivals, we should not respond, because these are not our festivals, and because they are not festivals which are acceptable to Allaah. These festivals are innovations in their religions, and even those which may have been prescribed formerly have been abrogated by the religion of Islaam, with which Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the whole of mankind. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
""Whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers."" \[Aal ‘Imraan 3:85\]  
It is haraam for a Muslim to accept invitations on such occasions, because this is worse than congratulating them as it implies taking part in their celebrations.

  
Similarly, Muslims are forbidden to imitate the kuffaar by having parties on such occasions, or exchanging gifts, or giving out sweets or food, or taking time off work, etc., because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever imitates a people is one of them."" Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book Iqtidaa’ al-siraat al-mustaqeem mukhaalifat ashaab al-jaheem: ""Imitating them in some of their festivals implies that one is pleased with their false beliefs and practices, and gives them the hope that they may have the opportunity to humiliate and mislead the weak.""  
Whoever does anything of this sort is a sinner, whether he does it out of politeness or to be friendly, or because he is too shy to refuse, or for whatever other reason, because this is hypocrisy in Islaam, and because it makes the kuffaar feel proud of their religion.  
Allaah is the One Whom we ask to make the Muslims feel proud of their religion, to help them adhere steadfastly to it, and to make them victorious over their enemies, for He is the Strong and Omnipotent.

But he chose the hard route to stand up for his people instead. And he has overall done a good job so far. He managed corona well, Skirmishes in 2019, and he is making much needed reforms to our economy.

There is no dilution. Hudaibiyah ki treaty political settlement nahi tau aur kiya thi. It’s stopped warfare and brought peace. IRA ke saath political settlement hui thi ya nahi. Political solutions are always preferred because fighting escalates. Pakistan has always offered political solution and talk to these groups and occassionally their fighters to take the amnesty offer we provide. Problem is BNP, BLA and BNM refuse to sit on the table with us. Their demand is full independence or terrorism. They are merely 2-3 tribes of dozens. Even in their tribes they don’t have full support. Like I said earlier, Jinke motivations destabilization ke hotay hain, their demands are unreasonable and unrealistic. TTP ke saath bhi multiple times political solution explore karnay ki koshesh ki, but they would pretend to hold talks and during talks they’d carry out bomb blasts and expect no reprisal.

Another thing these dramas are lacking is the uninspired camera work. I don't know anyone in the industry but I doubt these people have a DOP. Literally every single scene is shot like a stage drama. After a scene end the characters stand in silence and there the musical cue to transition into the next scene which is usually just another scene where characters are sitting down and have a brief conversation and this loops until the episode ends. They always use wide angle shots in someone's cramped ass tv lounge that they rented it's so damn lazy. Not to mention alot of our actors don't talk naturally especially the young ones who are only in it for their looks. I have not seen a single drama where we actually get to know about the characters and their lives outside of the basic plot. There has never been a single throwaway line in the dramas that tells us that these are real people who converse naturally with others.

goo505g,t3_lrdrlh,"I feel terrible for this parent, but is there *actually* any evidence that Nestle was responsible? There seems to be a lot of hate for Nestle in this thread, is there some background or previous scandal I've missed?

Companies making powdered baby milk have been rightly criticised for [implying that their milk is better than breast milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott), when for most babies , particularly in poorer countries, breast milk is a much better choice. This is the r[esponse from Nestle from around 1999](https://web.archive.org/web/20100516154701/http://www.babymilk.nestle.com/) which seems reasonable. Other than that, I couldn't find anything. 

[EDIT: the [description of this movie, ""Tigers""](https://www.lifegate.com/tigers-movie-denounce-nestle-formula-scandal)  suggests that at least some people in the company *were* at least behaving unethically, though not illegally - that is still the responsibility of the company. Isn't it the government's job to prevent companies behaving in a way that is harmful to its citizens? If baby milk is so harmful, why doesn't the government ban it, they seem to be quick to ban everything else including youtube a few years ago...]

Tragically, babies at that age sometimes die unexpectedly (see [Sudden infant death syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome), for no obvious reason. I think it's natural for the dad to look for answers, but any doctor in pakistan will tell you that family will often blame the doctors when something bad happens to their loved one, even when everything possible was done. Obviously, sometimes the doctors *did* do something wrong, my point is you can't tell just from the fact that someone made an accusation.

Isn't it weird that there was forensic analysis of the body, but *not the milk*? That would be much more of a smoking gun, which makes me think is was negative. How long after death the body was exhumed is also probably relevant - in pakistan there is usually only a cloth shroud, not a wooden coffin, so contamination of the body with material from the dirt around the body is highly likely - could that have contained the pesticide?

[This report from last year](https://www.facebook.com/khabarwala.pk/posts/fir-registered-against-nestle-pakistan-for-babys-death-due-to-poisonous-formula-/2354005448167419/) and a statement from nestle pakistan says that they were given a sample of the milk that was allegedly given to the child, and their tests suggest it was NOT their formula. Now it would be naive to believe that without independent tests, but it suggests the father still had access to the milk, so why wouldn't they also send *that* to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for testing? You can bet that if they had and it came up positive, it would be in this FIR, which suggests they didn't send it, or the test came up negative which completely undermines this case. 

Also, who here thinks the Pakistani Police services are professional and always committed to justice? Anyone? How likely do you think it is that the exhumation and forensic examination was carried out by the police forensic department themselves, with a fully-documented ""chain of evidence""? If not, Nestle will easily win this case, because there are so many ways for the toxins to have been introduced at some point in that chain. 

Even the whole ""Nestle made death threats"" or ""Nestle threatened the dad"" thing - have you seen any *evidence* for this, other than the dad just saying it? 

If the *facts* show that Nestle was responsible, I'm all in favor of punishing them to the full extent of the law. But if any of us was accused of something, we would want to be considered ""innocent until proven guilty"" - why wouldn't we want the same for this company and its management?",0,0,1614227152.0

-   Displacement of a large portion of the IVC population to South India during the 2nd millienium BC, which can only happen forcefully.

-  Displacement of IVC language, widespread use of Indo-Aryan languages in North India after Steppe invasion that brought Indo European languages

-    Hindu caste system which is extremely endogamous provides genetic proof of Aryans dominating South Asian populations. Brahmins and Kshtriyas, who form the ruling classes have high Aryan/Steppe ancestry. This only comes from invasion and subjugation, since these classes are at the top of the caste system and formed the ruling elite in India for more than 2000 years.

-   History of documented Aryan/Central Asian invasions into India from the north east of India, from the Huns to the Mughals. Those were not ''peaceful migrations'. On what basis should we assume the prior invasions in prehistory were 'migrations' and not 'invasions'?

Not all. Certainly some. There were other invasions as well. And assimilation’s and stuff.

But, one of characteristics of “India“ (which in past meant region around Indus) was it’s heavy central Asian influences compared to rest of South Asia. “India“ also includes a bit of north India - I’d say at least up till Delhi.However, Muslims ended up expanding frontiers of “Al-Hind” so much that it came to encompass all of South Asia.

2) My biggest argument is that the Aryans did not just ""migrate"" into India peacefully during the decline of IVC, peaceful migrations into populated areas by foreign groups 4000 years ago is not plausible. Aryans invaded, conquered, and that's why we speak a language that is connected to other areas of the world where this group went. Maybe a lot of the nomad Central Asia groups did ""migrate"", migration happens especially with herds, but India is not a grassland for Central Asian herders. it's most likely that Steppe nomads continued to trickle in after the initial wave of conquest. 

3) I agree with your hypothesis that Brahminism was formed in India, however I also know what study you quote. However the problem with quoting non-Brahmin admixtures is that because those groups are more exogamous. Gujjars for example are nomads, and Jatt (and even Rajput) are more flexible identities with a large umbrella, and have been so for at least 2 or 3 hundred years now. 

I don't understand what you are replying to, I cited that Steppe Ancestry is higher in Brahmins across the board which shows that this elite class either formed with the Aryan invasion or soon after it. The fact that some West North India populations have more Steppe admixture than even Brahmins, could be due to a host of factors, including consistent migration into NW India from Central Asia over the centuries. However this does not discredit 'invasion and conquest'. The language, the gods, the Brahmin admixtures already add weight to that argument.",4,1,1597247039.0

Which scholars? Indian? Sure lol

Pretty much all evidence points to an invasion, not a migration. Migration is just a politically correct way of saying invasion/subjugation. Much like the European ""migration"" into North America.  

1. Displacement of a large portion of the IVC population to South India during the 2nd millienium BC, which can only happen forcefully. 

2. Displacement of IVC language, widespread use of Indo-Aryan languages in North India after Steppe invasion that brought Indo European languages

3. Hindu caste system which is extremely endogamous provides genetic proof of Aryans dominating South Asian populations. Brahmins and Kshtriyas, who form the ruling classes have high Aryan/Steppe ancestry. This only comes from invasion and subjugation, since these classes are at the top of the caste system and formed the ruling elite in India for more than 2000 years. 

4. History of documented Aryan/Central Asian invasions into India from the north east of India, from the Huns to the Mughals. Those were not ''peaceful migrations'.

g176k52,t1_g171gjk,"Pakistanis and all South Asians as a whole share genetics with Iranians. Iranians are primarily a mixture of Iranian Neolithic Farmers and Anatolian Farmers with some Steppe\_MLBA (what you would call Aryan) and Caucasian Hunter Gatherer and very minimal amounts of AASE and Northeast Asian. The more South and East you go in Iran, the less Anatolian Farmer and more Steppe and AASE, and some southern parts of Iran have variable amounts of Subsaharan African ancestry. All South Asians are fundamentally a mixture of Iranian Neolithic Farmers, AASE, and Steppe MLBA. The more South and East you go, people have more AASE (and in the far Eastern parts of India, people, of course, have elevated East Asian ancestry). Pakistanis and certain North Indians like Greater Punjabis, certain Rajasthanis, Kashmiris, etc. being the most Northwestern South Asians, have the most Iranian Neolithic in the subcontinent, but some groups in India such as certain Patels in Gujarat can be particularly rich with Iranian Neolithic as well.

The main difference between modern Iranians and modern South Asian groups is that Iranians have significant amounts of direct Anatolian Farmer that they gained during the Chalcolithic period; whereas, most South Asians (including even Pashtuns) don't have anywhere near as much consistently on average, and whatever Anatolian Farmer South Asians do have was most likely gained from Steppe\_MLBA. And of course, the vast majority Iranians have very little to none AASE ancestry; whereas, it's a major ancestral component for South Asians. In fact, most Iranians live in the Northern and Western parts of Iran where there is not much AASE at all and can be practically considered to be virtually none.

Obviously yes, the individuals who act like Iranians and Pakistanis are the ""same"" are pretty annoying, but they also are a very small minority. However, there are concrete scientific genetic relationships between Iranians and South Asians as a whole, which is harbored by both groups sharing significant Iranian Neolithic ancestry.

However, I do study this field albeit all vaguely at this point as delving into the advanced side of this subject requires a lot of upper level CS, mathematics, biology, etc. which I am still studying concurrently (I am a physics major, was a former math/CS major at some point though). The information I have told you is far from even a glimpse into the surface of the subject's meat and potatoes. 

With Anatolian Turks (The ethnic Turks/Turkish people of Turkey), their genetic admixture varies depending on region and tribe/group of origin, but broadly speaking they are mostly Anatolian Farmer (which is maximized in Sardinians) with some Caucasian Hunter Gatherer, Iranian Neolithic Farmer, Levantine Neolithic and they have a variable Steppe component that is the highest in the Northern and Western parts, and lowest in the Eastern/Southern parts but this is not always a given as some Anatolian Turks could have ancestry from the Balkans, who like all Europeans have a lot more Steppe than Middle Eastern groups such as the average Anatolian Turks. Nonetheless, the Steppe in Turks fundamentally derives from a similar source as the Steppe in ethnic groups living in the Balkans so it has to be from the pre-Turkic expansion era and not from any Central Asian group as Central Asian groups carry the same type of Steppe of South Asians primarily (Sintashta MLBA), and Turks also score the highest Steppe in West Asia next to Northeast Caucasian groups such as Chechens. Iranians, Levantine/Gulf Arabs, Georgians/South-Ossetians, for example, score much less Steppe than most South Asians from Pakistan and Northwestern India on average, especially the ones after Iranians. The component that Central Asians did bring into Turkey/Anatolia, a relatively significant amount of for Western Asia (the Middle East), was a combination of Northeast Asian and Siberian, or we can just collectively refer to these two into some kind of Northeastern Eurasian. I believe Turks in Western and Central Turkey have the most Northeastern Eurasian, and Turks in Eastern Turkey have the least, contrary to what most people may superficially assume. This Northeastern Eurasian was brought in by Turkmen from what is now Turkmenistan. Some Turks can be modeled as almost 50% Greek and 50% Turkmenistani Turkmen.

jjz78om,t1_jjkb4ty,"Good luck with that.  Most OSPs I knew back in the states were dogmatically patriotic to Pakistan but drew the line at living here.  They (at least the older ones) live in a bubble and will bitch and moan about America (in an arrogant way in which they’re better than the rest of us Americans) but when asked to move back to Pakistan if they hate it there so much they find every excuse in the book that doesn’t involve telling the truth (“oh but my business/work/family/whatever other bullshit excuse”).  I’ll be honest, when I first accepted Islam and spent time in the masajid the worst people to hang around were the OSPs (I’m not talking about the students or Pakistanis in the US temporarily).  They’d invite you to their house just to show off how wealthy they were (this was so cringe, and peak stupid, for all they knew I could’ve been casing the place for burglary and they gave me everything except the combination to their safe), maybe give me a cup of tea and I’d realize I wasted an entire afternoon at their house just looking at their Armani suits and other bullshit.  The entire time they’d be insulting my own country and my own people.  

The ones who were born and raised in the US (only country I’m really familiar with OSPs, despite having lived in the UK prior to being Muslim), are highly assimilated and don’t behave like this, but their immigrant parents are like this bad and wealthier people here are like this.  I just couldn’t get over the complete lack of self awareness they had insulting everyone in my own country while benefitting from the opportunity there and then doing it to my face.  And then God help you if you wanted to marry their daughter, no, their daughter’s only purpose was getting the rest of the family out of Pakistan through forced marriage (unless you were filthy rich and the same caste or whatever unislamic bullshit excuse they had).  There were some exceptions to this but by and large this was my experience (had a very good friend who left Pakistan in the 70’s and was a huge PPP bigwig but now criticizes everything that you all criticize and I would criticize, and never ever gives an air of superiority, may Allah take care of him ameen).  And they will try to force feed you whatever madhab they follow and you’re basically a kafir if you don’t do exactly as they do (I see this here too with the masjid uncles, I loved the Arabs in the states because they wouldn’t force their views down your throat and actually had proper Islamic sources for whatever they told you and not some superstitious old wives tale).",1,1,1683966520.0

Though I agree, if we had competent leadership that weren’t kleptocrats we could industrialize and become a real economic powerhouse.  My issue with Imran Khan is he betted all of Pakistan’s development money on these stupid housing societies thinking it’ll bring in OSP investments (it won’t) and we will never get that money back.

Being Istanbul's mayor is already quiet a political position as it's a cosmopolitan city filled with people from not only all over the country, but internationally.

He was removed for a controversial line in a poem mosques are our barracks, minarets our lances, domes our helmets. That's when he set up the AKP. Which won elections, some say to his jail term for the poem, bit the country was kind of stale and he had charisma. Turkey was heavily conservative, as most rural countries are.

But as Prime Minister he continued and expanded the country's Economic plans and truly brought economic prosperity. International he was seen as a reformer, lenient on the forced secularity of the country but some thoughts ran against progressivism. 

Using courts for favorable results, controversial constitutional referendums that granted him powers (presidential, party chairmanship, judicial), censorship, corruption, to name a few major ones.

The 2 level game is; Internationally he took up Neo-Ottomanism. He felt since Turkey was the successor to the Ottoman it had a place covering N. Africa and the Middle East. And domestically routinely went against Ataturk's vision of secularism. Incorporation of religiously inclined individuals into government, removal of headscarf ban (ironic), Danayet (state administration of religion) expanded also exported, clearing of secularism in education.

This is a myth created by Indians to explain how they were colonized.

No we didn't, we invested money there, we caved into their tantrums, hell Pakistan is the only government they have had in the past 500 years that DIDN'T cause a famine. MILLIONS of them died due to famine in 74 due to the mismanagement of their new government. But since that doesn't fit the narrative of ""Pakistan bad"" so it never gets mentioned. Think about that, more Bengalis died from the mismanagement of Mujibur Rahman in 74 then the war. But what do you hear? ""ThReE GrOzIllIoN bRaZiLlIoN dEeEeEaD iN 71""    


> Nukes will save West Pakistan if we do not learn from pre 71 lessons

We have learned from 71. We are STILL a proud multiethnic state that is built around tolerance for its ethnicities. Unlike the Ethnostate that is Bangladesh, where the first thing they did was take citizenship away from Urdu speakers since their land is only for Bengalis.

[https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/14/asia/taiwan-china-taipei-people-intl-hnk/index.html](https://edition.cnn.com/2021/10/14/asia/taiwan-china-taipei-people-intl-hnk/index.html)

Taiwanese separatism is actually not being driven by the native aboriginals of Taiwan (as is the case for Palestine for example) but Han people (primarily pro-DPP, Hoklo-speaking background) in Taiwan pushing to construct an artifical Taiwanese identity which itself is vague and they're confused to either mold it as a civic identity or ""Hoklo linguistic-identity"" or infuse it with Japanese-occupation colonial culture. It's essentially an identity crisis.

Aboriginal people in Taiwan strongly support the Kuomintang currently, which basically supports maintaining cross-strait relations with the PRC and maintaining Taiwan's status quo under the Constitution of the Republic of China (ROC). The aboriginal people were treated harshly during the Japanese occupation, so the fact that the DPP (the main rival of Kuomintang, and the main party pushing for independent Taiwan) bootlicks Japan is not going to help them gain support as well as being associated as mainly representing Hoklo-speaking ""interests"".

What needs to happen under reunification is to guarantee provincial government positions to Aboriginal representatives. Same thing China already does in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet.

An independent, pro-US Taiwan only helps the West in its colonial interests against the eastern bloc (WHICH INCLUDES PAKISTAN). If countries were to start making political decisions on the basis of naive idealism, this entire region would slip into chaos and instability.",7,2,1635724478.0

And you base your entire argument for unified China based on what the Taiwanese Aboriginals want? That’s like 3% of the population.

As for the Eastern Bloc argument, I really couldn’t care less. I don’t view a people’s demand to self governance through some nationalistic angle. I support their movement for the same reason I support Kashmir, Palestine, and others. If the people want self-governance, they deserve self-governance. Your way of viewing everything through nationalistic goggles is how the congress viewed the Pakistan independence movement, how the Indian government views the Kashmir struggle, how Israel views the Palestinian struggle, and generally how every oppressor views those against them.

hiu165r,t1_hitwv16,"Mate, I don't know what you think Taiwan's 'demand to self governance' is exactly.

hiud0o0,t1_hiu29d9,"The moral idea of self-determination doesn’t justify everything. The US confederacy also “self-determined” to go for independence. The Austrian Anschluss was decided through an Austrian plebiscite. You need to make a decision whether to support it or not based on the individual cases. And the stats you quoted just confirm that the majority prefer the status quo to remain or are indifferent anyway so the point about self determination doesn't really hold. If Taiwan wants to be independent so badly, they could start by declaring it.

With that said, the whole 'free Taiwan' thing looks like moral posturing to me; implicitly playing directly into the hands of bloodthirsty western warhawks but justifying it on moral grounds like 'we should support secessionist forces in Taiwan because democracy'. It's impossible to understand this thinking other than that your, and only your morals trump everything else, be it war, poverty, or hunger.",2,1,1635735889.0
hiugtau,t1_hiud0o0,"The stats I quoted show that the vast majority of Taiwanese people don’t want any more closeness to China than they currently have (which is minimal), which is more than your earlier “only a small group” claim. Taiwan operates independently of China and for all intents and purposes is an independent nation with its own army, government, president, etc.

As far as Taiwan’s self-determination goes, the basis of it lies in the age old communist vs democratic struggle. I for one, believe in the democratic way of life and support people’s right to self-determination the way they see fit. My religious and social views don’t align with the communist way of life.

As for morals, well, my or anyone else’s morals don’t really matter when they go against the interests of the majority of concerned party. I accept the Afghan’s choice of (or inaction against) the Taliban regime even though I don’t like the Taliban. Had I been older at the time, I would have supported East-Pakistan’s call to self govern. I support Kashmiris’ right to self determination, whether that’s with India or Pakistan or neither. I support the Palestinians cause to self-determination. All of these I support because their people want as much.",3,1,1635737903.0

I remember our teacher telling all of us to gather in one corner of the class for safety reasons but hearing constant gun fire and mini blasts was horrific but not surprising since in those times you would hear about terrorist attacks every single day. Lost a close friend but his brother survived and probably many of my junior school friends that were currently in the grade that were affected the most from it. Many other incidents including bomb blast right outside my mom college (federal) where she taught, a bomb that was kept outside the gate of my sister's school (army public school girls branch) which was alhumdulliah defused right infront of our eyes, to begin Evacuated several times from our school to safe areas incase of a potential threat, to feeling shock waves and seeing bomb clouds almost every other day when coming back from school or going outside, and blasts happening at places which we would normally visit or times where if we were there a couple minutes/hours early or late, we would have been victims of those attacks. Those were scary times but APS attack really broke the seal and I highly doubt the terrorism would have stopped if that didn't happen 💔 I remember there weren't even enough ambulances that day and would see alot of them stop mid way at the side of the road for whatever horrific reason I don't want to know.",0,6,1608140341.0

I don't get what you're saying, or which country you're referring to. I'm an Indian lurker btw. The point is that, yesterday I saw the same picture on another sub asking for Indian blood as revenge for the murdered children in the Peshawas school attack, with the comments suggesting to ""carpet bomb"" the embassies and execute all the remaining diplomats, etc.

I was taken totally by surprise, cuz I had seen the news too then and was saddened by the barbaric attack by Taliban on a school. I still don't get how and why India would be called responsible for it. Yeah I get it that Pakistanis hate India as much as Indian hate Pakistan. Pakistan is sometimes unfairly called responsible for everything in India, and when you hate someone, he's called Pakistani agent. I agree that not all of the so called ""evidence against Pakistan"" shown are not genuine.

But I think it's insane to call India responsible for that. Not that India would never do such a thing, my holy country is always right, that kinda thing. But Pakistan has has always had a heavy presence of many terrorist entities in it's soil. Taliban had control of an entire region of Pakistan, Malala was shot at Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden was killed at Pakistan, and Ajmal Kasab an the other terrorists behind the Mumbai attack were legit Pakistanis. Sad that despite being called terrorists, more Pakistanis have suffered at the hands of these terrorists, and Pakistan has the right to call itself more the victim of terrorism as it has suffered the most. India has only had a few terror attacks when compared to that. 

I wouldn't brand an entire nation/race as terrorists. Especially when before 73 years, we shared the same name, especially a region that gave birth to many of our greatest freedom fighters, especially a place that has had more martyrs and widows of terror-victims. I think Pakistan did a mistake by getting involved in the Soviet-American affairs and recruiting it's own men to fight the soviets in Afghanistan, and it's the same that backfired as Taliban and is causing havoc. I'm just glad that India didn't have to get involved in this, as Pakistan actively became a buffer zone.",4,2,1608178222.0

You cant go to war because you can't afford it. Plain and simple. The only thing you can do is to bring people on your side. 

PM is tweeting because he's using his soft power to get the message across. He's doing quite a lot in comparison to previous leaderships. 

Arab brothers don't owe you anything. In politics, there's no brotherhood, but alliances and alliances change in seconds. Using religion to get money or support will never work especially in this age, where war will catastrophic. Saudi is about to invest $15 Billion in India. Saudi is also number one supporter and Finance of Yemen war. Why would you think they will care about Kashmiris  ? They also slaughtered their own journalists. Khoshagi is one of the prime example. In this age, everyone is trying to protect themselves. Even Pakistan. Pakistan didn't utter a single word against China brutality on Uighurs. They didn't say anything against China clamping people in HongKong. 

Lastly, I agree, Pakistan needs to be strong internally. Better infrastructure, equal opportunity, job creation, and all. I agree, Pakistan needs to sort out its priorities.

It's supposed to be the other way around right? If you drop testing, you will find lower amount of cases.

Also, how can you say the ratio is 1:3, while comparing tests/million and the total cases?

India has 1380 million
Pakistan has 221 million

Compare these two
1380 million for India's tests/million
221 million for Pakistan's tests/million

Since india has more millions of population, and the whole virus is based on an exponential trajectory, there is no way you can point a 1:3 ratio.

A better explanation would be for seeing cases/million and tests/million.

Pakistan- 1340 cases/million
India - 2788 cases/ million

Hence despite testing 3x more in india, the number of people infected is only 2x more, per million.

But like I said, even this is not perfect because you can't really compare such drastic differences in the population and come up with a simple ratio.",5,1,1599113331.0

Also, what I am saying is that each and every one of those 1.4 billion people living in India don't deserve what is happening. You are no one to ""judge"" divine intervention. You have to go with, India this and India that, or Kashmir this, Kashmir that, but why can't you just be human? Not all of the people living there sent Pakistan death wishes, or boasted about the vaccine so why hate all. Its a fucking tragedy that you can't look an inch past what is happening in Kashmir or on Twitter. Last week, on average, an Indian person was dying every 5 minutes. Now are you telling me, that there were no good people who died? There is a village named Kartarpur in India that has Sikh inhabitants. It was originally a Muslim village but they fled after partition. The people that moved there saw the graves and knew that they must do something. To this day, they are maintaining the graves left by the Muslim families by using Muslim traditions and following Muslim practices. But, to you, these people are just another Indian who deserved your so called ""divine intervention"" and all of them personally travelled to Kashmir and spat on the peoples faces, beat them and called them names. Is that it? Is that why you hate them as well? Is that well deserved? Apparently, they deserved your ""divine intervention"" because they are terrible, sick people who had it coming. Grow up.

gvup8d7,t1_gvu18yg,"I was mentioning historical ties with India here. Not familial ones.

&#x200B;

Remember not so long ago (70ish years) Indo-Pak was a single country and before that, Punjab and Sindh especially as well as KP had access and a cultural similitude with India. 

&#x200B;

The status of Farsi was like the status of English currently: a 'court' language spoken by the Ashraaf muslim (and even elite Hindu) families. The British banned it being taught and replaced English with it, and they did so brutally. Even so, too few remnants of it have survived for it to have been a common person's language. Farsi was, thus, predominantly a language of the elite mughal-era families, and an additional language taught in the many Madaaris of the subcontinent. 

&#x200B;

Converting your 90% estimate on its head, most of Pakistanis share little to no familial and lingualistic ties to Afghans or Turks, and this includes regions like Balochistan and KPK. On the other hand, the cities and vilages on the border have a lot of present day ties to the cities on the other side (India). One can say that the region of present day Pakistan is not separate from the larger subcontinent in any coherent terms, we were/are similar. The difference is not historical, but rather has been politically constructed to build a nation, which was a pragmatic requirement in our formative years. 

This is the same with India, of course, wherein it has rarely been a united whole, and has mostly been throughout its history controlled by different kingdoms.

&#x200B;

This obsession with finding Turkic, Arabic, and now 'Afghan' roots reeks of denial and a self-loathing of our rich history as a civilization along the banks of the Indus. Hopefully, this discourse of hatred gives way to the understanding that we share common problems and we can work together to solve them sometimes.",6,5,1619380794.0

This is about a recent rape case in which a woman and her 4 year-old daughter were sexually assaulted and raped for days. The rapists held the woman’s daughter and told her to bring another child to replace her. This is where Muhammad Bux sent his OWN daughter to safely rescue the 4 year old and catch one of the rapists. What an absolute legend. Deserves all the praise and medals this country can bestow.

Edit: Govt of Sindh has announced to cover his daughter’s education expense and also recommended her for a civilian award for her bravery. Bux Sahab will also be given a gallantry award by GoS. GoS has also recommended the federal govt. that Bux Sahab be awarded the highest police award.",0,191,1605263010.0

Marvel's avengers has no predecessor that's even remotely like it so the devs had to take a route. I'm pretty sure future iterations of the game will be pretty good.

Criticizing marvel's avengers is like criticizing the galaxy fold for not being perfect. It's a new design and they didn't have anything to work with. I'm pretty sure the game will get better with updates.

Also check out the mass effect series, it's pretty fun.",5,0,1599246072.0
g40ahma,t1_g40840p,"Spider-man ps4 was a pure luck that it existed. When marvel and Sony made a deal that Spider-Man will be in the MCU, one of the condition was that marvel's next game will be Sony exclusive. Marvel gave Sony few characters to select then sony asked insomniac to pick one and they picked Spider-Man. That's how Spider-Man PS4 came into existence. Maybe maybe when marvel and Sony renew their deal last oct, they may have allowed Sony to use Spider-Man in Sony exclusive games.

gyvvrbe,t3_nhcjv9,"Political scientist and professor of international relation at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, John J. Mearsheimer, wrote a book in 2006 called *[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/The_Israel_Lobby_and_U.S._Foreign_Policy)*. In it, he methodically describes how the US media and its foreign policy are influenced by Isreal through financial and other means.

A [student at MIT](https://twitter.com/h_jackson_/status/1395406952180633601) used [machine learning](https://github.com/hollyjackson/NYT_Content_Analysis) to analyze NYT coverage and found that references to Palestinians were >1.5x likelier to use violent language than references to Israelis. Reports also referred to Palestinians >2x more frequently in passive voice & were consistently more negative, which minimizes the responsibility of Israeli aggressors. 

In an undercover Al Jazeera investigation, [pro-Isreal lobbyists were caught boasting about how much their money influences Washington](https://theintercept.com/2019/02/11/ilhan-omar-israel-lobby-documentary/). 

> David Ochs, founder of HaLev, which helps send young people to American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s annual conference, described for the reporter how AIPAC and its donors organize fundraisers outside the official umbrella of the organization, so that the money doesn’t show up on disclosures as coming specifically from AIPAC. He describes one group that organizes fundraisers in both Washington and New York. “This is the biggest ad hoc political group, definitely the wealthiest, in D.C.,” Ochs says, adding that it has no official name, but is clearly tied to AIPAC. “It’s the AIPAC group. It makes a difference; it really, really does. It’s the best bang for your buck, and the networking is phenomenal.” (Ochs and AIPAC did not immediately return The Intercept’s requests for comment.)

> Without spending money, Ochs argues, the pro-Israel lobby isn’t able to enact its agenda. “Congressmen and senators don’t do anything unless you pressure them. They kick the can down the road, unless you pressure them, and the only way to do that is with money,” he explains.

Sadly, the toy in question (a toy truck, to be precise) broke down within hours! Went to the shopkeeper, who I thought was a nice fellow, but when I asked for a replacement he showed me his big, angry, scary eyes that I'll never forget and basically told me to shove off. When I begged and told him how I was saving up that money for a month he literally pushed me out of his shop because I was creating quite a racket, apparently.

Child abuse?!

Needless to say; sh!t like that sticks with you for life! Which brings us to my rule numero uno:

First, the establishment isn't the military, it's a bunch of high ranking officials in the judiciary, government institutions, intelligence, military and even civilians.

Since Pakistan has always (justifiably) been paranoid National security state, rooted from existential threats, it was no surprise that the military had to keep on its toes and that the establishment heavily favors them.

The other government institutions refused to shape up which is why military is forced to step in every time.

In fact, we should all be thankful for Musharraf's coup forcing Nawaz Sharif out of government, he had been looking to do to the military what he had done to the judiciary, law enforcement, and bureaucracy of Pakistan, politicize it and fill it with people loyal to him.

Before this he had dismissed a very popular COAS and replaced him with Musharraf who wasn't exactly the most senior military officer, then he had actually replaced Musharraf as the COAS with a cousin who he had assigned as DG ISI before both of them were arrested.

Bhutto had done this very same thing with Zia, to have a weak puppet COAS but got hanged instead. Nawaz should have been hanged too. 

He played with the lives of all the people on that flight just to screw Musharraf over.

>The government as a whole must be held accountable. What protocols are in place for such situations? The Mayor in Murree should have asked the governor of Punjab for help. The governor should then have arranged help (military or other) with the PM\President's help if necessary.

Yes, definitely. 

>And maybe that is what happened behind the scenes. Maybe the army was mobilized after all this communication.

Maybe, but this shouldn't have escalated to deaths. They should have done their work and predicted the influx of tourists. And they should have made arrangements in Murree regarding such weather conditions, maybe keep the armed forces on alert if they didn't have policemen or labour to clear the roads. And at the very least they should have clearly warned people by sending out a PSA about such weather conditions (although I don't think it was that severe personally, it was made severe due to negligence).

yes it is solid advice, if you really think about it, no one wants to think about it because it seems draconian, but honestly its the last thing left to do. The ""city"" is jam packed 7 days a week, the roads cant sustain the traffic. They overcharge for everything and act like badmash. Things need to be reset to quite an extent. And this is the perfect chance to do it. 

and yes, what i have against ""desis"" or rather desi mentality is exactly this, they point and laugh in the face of any illness wear no masks, congregate every chance they get, then get sick, bitch and moan like no ones business and then complain its the governments fault. same with dengue, same with corona. i personally know people who think the vaccine is adding magnetic things to their arm and now things stick to their arms. And now they are refusing the vaccine because its free, but these same morons were complaining that the vaccine wasnt available and should be free like a year ago. 

They are then pointing and laughing in the face of danger, then bitching and moaning when things go sideways. just like right now. same concept. its a fucking tragedy. what did the kids have to do with their parents stupid choices? the kids didnt know jackshit. and therefore any surviving parent should definitely be charged, jailed and their driving licenses stripped away. They not only put their own family in danger and killed them, but they aided in jam packing a hard to reach area and made it an issue for everyone else and basically aided in the deaths and trauma of others. 

I literally read a report on December 20th telling us to expect heavy snowfall and be careful on dawn.com, but does anyone GIVE A SHIT? nope. 

&#x200B;

i have no angst from Canada in this regard. everyone knows you need to look out for the weather before traveling. if you get stuck in your own transport or public transport, not everyone is so understanding. You should think before you venture out whether you are putting your life at risk or not, and its usually the people with desi mindsets who think that a bit of snow, ice and rain cant hurt them...in their 2wd corollas without snow tires (because kon kharcha karay), and then cause traffic jams, accidents and have rescue operations conducted, and then they are fucking charged for it, if its deemed that they could have easily avoided all this.

Muslims does not care about your religion/race.
We embrace everyone. You too.

And about filling context, well BJP is doing/ will do anything to kick muslim population in their hand.

And of course to show Pakistan that India is powerful than Pakistan.
Just like they did during 1971 Pak vs Bangladesh  war.

Meanwhile Pakistan claims ownership of Kashmir, India claims ownership  of Kashmir.  Between  both countries claimings Kashmir remained helpless.

But Pakistan did not commissioned 40 thousand troops on their side of kashmir, they did not shut down kashmir for months.

But India is doing so.

India cut down communication line, did not let any international media and human rights activists enter kashmir, violated multiple UN laws. 

In case you did not know BJP is making list of people who came from another country and became citizen of India(legally). 
Why the list? To kick Muslim out.

Don't trust my words? Okay.

Search Amit Shah and muslims on youtube.

He himself said, ""We will make list of everyone who came outside of india and became citizen. We will provide full citizenship to Sikh, Christian,Hindu,Buddhist brothers""

He did not mention Muslim.  He is notorious for hating Muslims.

And thanks  to your madarchod media.
Indian media are the one who are brainwashing innocent indian people under the pressure of government. 

It is Ex Pakistani PMs,  Presidents and current Indian Ruling party who is to blame.

You may have heard of go rakhshak right?

What do they do? They kill any muslim carrying cow or cow meat.

Yes I Understand thay Cow is compared to mother in hindu religion.  I have no issues for that. You are free to practice your belief.

But.
Does geeta says to kill any Muslim who carries beef?

It is your religion that says cows are comoared to mother not their.
Does your religion teaches you to kill?

I know it is not.

Who is behind spreading this kind of hatred?

Your illiterate PM who did not go to school, does not know how the world runs and his BJP party.

I hope I have filled all your blank spaces.

And if you have the opportunity to take good debt like that, you are leaving money on the table by not doing it. The US govt takes on debt because it is meant to invest in the growth of their economy. And so far it has not been too shabby about servicing that debt. It's still working out flin their favour by far.

2. Economic relations go two ways. China needs access to the US market more than the US needs access to Chinese manufacturing. Don't get me wrong, a break in trade relations would be devastating for both. But it would be worse for China, no contest. The US market composes 25% of the WORLD's GDP. China is 9%. The USD is 75% of the world's ForEx reserves. RMB is 2%. The US can manufacture elsewhere, it will be expensive but not impossible. If China decides to do the trade equivalent of nuclear war, the first party to benefit will be India. Then the next will be Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh. Then Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia.

The biggest irony is us south indians are the ones who are responsibly controlling the population, hdi and improving the economy in a stable manner, but doing so is hurting us by giving more weightage to the overpopulated poverty stricken north. 

The country is also represented by the north cowbelt internationally, which is why people meme indians a lot and give us a bad name when we go outside.

From whatever i can understand from the modia, TMC and mamata is plain nasty and violent. There maybe some truth to it. Im surprised there arent any new political parties coming up if people are disatisfied with the TMC. Very odd congress doesnt even exist there. I can understand why people no longer trust the CPM though. Why is the TMC even pandering to the irritating and disgusting islamic mullahs ? Muslims only vote between the tmc,cpm,bjp and independant. They dont have much of a choice in the matter in the end. Nobody should pander to the fanatics of any religion, at the very least not so openly and directly to the point the other communities feel threatened.

I wonder whether people even realize the PM they have voted for is an actual clinical psychopath. Just looking at his facial expressions and his eyes tells you something is seriously wrong with him, apart from his past actions and rumours. Psychopaths knows how to control the people in the most charismatic manner without any remorse, and understands the base desires of an average human.

The Official Secrets Amendment Bill of 2023 and the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill received approval from both the National Assembly and the Senate. Subsequently, they were forwarded to the President for his approval.

Yesterday, news broke that the President had signed the bills into law.

However, in this tweet today, the President announced that he had not signed the bills. He had directed his staff to return the bills instead. The President's tweet insinuates that his staff disregarded his instructions by not returning the bills within time.

According to the Constitution, the President can return a bill twice to the Parliament for reconsideration. The bill must be returned within the provided timeframe, otherwise it would be considered as approved by the President.

It's important to note that the country is presently without an elected assembly and is being governed by a caretaker administration. Generally, this means that any returned bill will await reconsideration until the next elected assembly convenes, after the General Elections.",0,25,1692534753.0

The heroic assault forced the shooter to stumble to the ground.

After that maybe the shooter just assumed he was dead. The initial shots during the tackle hit around his left shoulder or arm, maybe most of them even hopefully missed... but the final 3 or 4 while he was laying on the ground 100% hit him.

eimnir4,t1_eimcfq1,"I saw the video. Naeem Rashid tried to tackle the **terrorist** when the **terrorist** was turned and shooting at one group of innocent civilians on the right side of the mosque. The **terrorist's bloodthirst** made him tunnel vision and when he turned around it seems Naeem Rashid was already half way into a tackle attempt... unfortunately it failed.

**Naeem Rashid was braver than most men ever could dream to be.** He charged a **terrorist** who was armed to the teeth with military grade hardware. I doubt a coward who hides on reddit and spews Islamophobic dogwhistles would know anything about bravery.

I looked through your comment history since I had already RES tagged you for saying some other Islamophobic things like:

> [They aren’t even close to us. Texas has a bigger economy than England. We can own guns. We arent over run with islamists and we keep Islam in check here. We have free speech. They arrest people for tweets and steak knives. Their economy is shit. Their armed forces are weak. It’s not really even close. India is ahead of England. 😂](https://np.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/awncoz/the_uk_isnt_superior_to_america_and_people_need/ehnrcc4)

Islamophobes and terrorist sympathizers are not welcome here. I am glad I made a note on your username a while back in case you tried to show up here. You are here to revel in the pain of others by marginalizing the act of bravery of a man who tried to save people. **Shame on you.**

You are banned. Stop harassing Muslims and other minorities.

While the shooter was distracted trying to kill everyone playing dead in a corner, he charges at the shooter from behind. Who then spun around to get 6 shots off at the victim during the tackle. The heroic assault forced the shooter to stumble to the ground. But after that Naeem Rashid was down for good, laying there helpless while the shooter gets back up and walks backwards firing off 3-4 more shots from a close distance to ""finish him off"".

After that maybe the shooter just assumed he was dead. The initial shots during the tackle hit around his left shoulder or arm, maybe most of them even hopefully missed... but the final 3 or 4 while he was laying on the ground 100% hit him. I really do hope he survives because that's a lot of punishment to take up close like that. It explains why after all those times walking over him he never fired again at least.",4,6,1552684857.0

While the shooter was distracted trying to kill everyone playing dead in a corner, he charges at the shooter from behind. Who then spun around to get 6 shots off at the victim during the tackle. The heroic assault forced the shooter to stumble to the ground. But after that Naeem Rashid was down for good, laying there helpless while the shooter gets back up and walks backwards firing off 3-4 more shots from a close distance to ""finish him off"".

After that maybe the shooter just assumed he was dead. The initial shots during the tackle hit around his left shoulder or arm, maybe most of them even hopefully missed... but the final 3 or 4 while he was laying on the ground 100% hit him. I really do hope he survives because that's a lot of punishment to take up close like that. It explains why after all those times walking over him he never fired again at least.",4,8,1552684857.0

The heroic assault forced the shooter to stumble to the ground.

After that maybe the shooter just assumed he was dead.

eimcoup,t1_eimcfq1,"I saw the video. He definitely did tackle and the shooter did fumble his step due it.

eimnir4,t1_eimcfq1,"I saw the video. Naeem Rashid tried to tackle the **terrorist** when the **terrorist** was turned and shooting at one group of innocent civilians on the right side of the mosque. The **terrorist's bloodthirst** made him tunnel vision and when he turned around it seems Naeem Rashid was already half way into a tackle attempt... unfortunately it failed.

**Naeem Rashid was braver than most men ever could dream to be.** He charged a **terrorist** who was armed to the teeth with military grade hardware. I doubt a coward who hides on reddit and spews Islamophobic dogwhistles would know anything about bravery.

I looked through your comment history since I had already RES tagged you for saying some other Islamophobic things like:

> [They aren’t even close to us. Texas has a bigger economy than England. We can own guns. We arent over run with islamists and we keep Islam in check here. We have free speech. They arrest people for tweets and steak knives. Their economy is shit. Their armed forces are weak. It’s not really even close. India is ahead of England. 😂](https://np.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/awncoz/the_uk_isnt_superior_to_america_and_people_need/ehnrcc4)

Islamophobes and terrorist sympathizers are not welcome here. I am glad I made a note on your username a while back in case you tried to show up here. You are here to revel in the pain of others by marginalizing the act of bravery of a man who tried to save people. **Shame on you.**

You are banned. Stop harassing Muslims and other minorities.

Edit: He even revealed himself to be a troll in modmail. Its almost like he thinks that white supremacists are going to treat him any different than any other minority. So delusional. They hate all minorities just as bad as Pakistanis.",6,10,1552695194.0
