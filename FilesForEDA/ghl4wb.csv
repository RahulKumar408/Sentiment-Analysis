fq9xtg0,t1_fq9rwhp,"Ambedkar was in favour of a plebiscite, distinguishing between Jammu and the Valley. And yeah, there is a scary possibility (to Indians) that Kashmir would have chosen to secede.

In truth this issue has gone on so long that the problem has festered like an open sore. Relatively very few Kashmiris lived pre-independence, and as such have lived the majority of their lives on opposite sides of their border. 

I don't know how happy the citizens of POK (don't hate pls, you may call it whatever you want) are, but I know that Indian Kashmiris... Definitely have a fair degree of mistrust towards India. The fact of the matter is that both governments have treated Kashmir as a piece of real estate with extreme strategic value, and the people themselves have been treated as expendable.

It's unfortunate, because if the Kashmiris had not engaged in militancy and the Armed Forces had not cracked down so brutally at various times (and both those factors are essentially the faults of governments), at this point the people of the region would have probably integrated far better with the rest of India. Article 370 has anyway been greatly diluted over the years, and is more of a right wing talking point than any real source of friction between Kashmiris and other Indians. 

In any case, as an Indian, I personally hope that within our lifetimes, Indians and Pakistanis liberate ourselves from our pseudo-theocratic overlords and manage to find a bilateral solution to the Kashmir problem that prioritises the Kashmiri people, who are at least in my opinion the only ones whose opinions ought to really matter here.

Because hopefully after that India and Pakistan will be able to achieve the close diplomatic ties that are frankly a no-brainer, and to cooperate against the real threat of this century, China.

fqaarcr,t1_fq9xtg0,"Your entire comment is just attempting to shift a lot of the blame onto the Kashmiris and then put Pakistan and India on equal footing as to their treatment of Kashmir.

Firstly, the Kashmiris *responded* with violence because of India's actions. India directly interfered with their elections and peaceful protests got them nowhere. When they revolted, India thought it could quash them with its army. 

Jammu is only Hindu majority because the Muslims were genocided by Dogra fanatics, so I personally don't support drawing a distinction between there and the Valley. 

Secondly, do watch YouTube videos of AJK/Pak-administered Kashmir to get an actual view of what happens there. Indians always call it ""POK"" which is quite astonishing given that, as I'm sure you know, the residents of that region want nothing to do with you. The Kashmiris of IoJK already want nothing to do with you. 

Maybe calling it ""POK"" is a coping tactic but just be honest with yourself. There's the Indian narrative, and then there's reality. Speak to a Gilgiti, Mirpuri or Kashmiri in real life and tell them they're just Indians who are occupied by Pakistan, you'll find out if what you've been fed all these years is true. 

You said you want a solution prioritise Kashmiris yet stop short of supporting a referendum. A referendum is the only *peaceful* solution and it's many decades overdue, courtesy of India as usual. 


I don't know where you got this Indo-Pak anti-China alliance idea from but I wouldn't be in support of it because it wouldn't work, given the small issue that Indians have been brainwashed into hating us. Plus India wants to be a regional hegemon so it wouldn't be very beneficial to Pakistan anyway. I'd rather just pit the two against each other. 

I'm also not in support of close relations with India, we can see how it treats Nepal and Bangladesh. No thank you. If Kashmir is liberated from India, then I would support minimal trade relations initially, that's it. If China is the threat of this century, then India would be the threat of the next. I see no reason to trust it or assist it in its goal of becoming regional hegemon.

Tl;Dr: stop blaming the Kashmiris, Pak and India are not equal in treatment of Kashmir, a referendum is the only peaceful solution but India refuses to hold one (and likely never will) and a close alliance with India is implausible and foolish.",2,39,1589215841.0
fqd5otd,t1_fq9xtg0,"There is no comparison between how India treats Kashmiris and how Pakistanis treat them. Not only does the Indian state brutally oppress Kashmiris, the Indian society gaslights and harbours active fantasies of raping Kashmiri women.
You won’t find both of those happening in Pakistan. 

Kashmiris engaged in militancy precisely because of the suppression of their right and denial of their voice in elections. They wouldn’t have integrated because they never signed up for India in the first place; the Maharaja did by deceit but the society never did.  Which is why you have the conflict in the first place.

But it seems like no discussion is worthwhile. Indian society dehumanises Kashmiris as terrorists and harbours rape fantasies whereas Indian state is clearly going to conduct ethnic cleansing of Kashmiris.
