ews2oef,t1_ewrxvnk,"Everything starts with criticism. Make noise, until people and countries start taking notice of the issue. There are so many people who have no clue about Kashmir problem and in fact don't even know that the place exists. The only way you can spread the message is by sharing articles, and statements. You cant go to war because you can't afford it. Plain and simple. The only thing you can do is to bring people on your side. 

PM is tweeting because he's using his soft power to get the message across. He's doing quite a lot in comparison to previous leaderships. 

Arab brothers don't owe you anything. In politics, there's no brotherhood, but alliances and alliances change in seconds. Using religion to get money or support will never work especially in this age, where war will catastrophic. Saudi is about to invest $15 Billion in India. Saudi is also number one supporter and Finance of Yemen war. Why would you think they will care about Kashmiris  ? They also slaughtered their own journalists. Khoshagi is one of the prime example. In this age, everyone is trying to protect themselves. Even Pakistan. Pakistan didn't utter a single word against China brutality on Uighurs. They didn't say anything against China clamping people in HongKong. 

Lastly, I agree, Pakistan needs to be strong internally. Better infrastructure, equal opportunity, job creation, and all. I agree, Pakistan needs to sort out its priorities. You can't eat Nuclear weapons, and it will definitely not help the country prosper. But don't forget that Pakistan has the duty to call out any human rights, and border violation.

Most Jews have no racist-based hatred towards South Asians, blacks, Oriental etc. Many, if not most Arabs do. To them, they are Arab first, and Muslim second. 

AstugfurAllah. May Allah guide them to the correct path and rid their hearts of bigoted hatred that has no place in Islam.

Edit: also I see a lot of Arabs treat kuffar white people (nothing wrong with them having another religion, my point is they only treat the whites better because they consider being white a high status) better than they treat their own Muslim brothers from South Asia who are just a little more dark skinned and lacking in social status.
