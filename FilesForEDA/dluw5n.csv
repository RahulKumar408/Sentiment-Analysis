Yes violence was used to try and calm things down when the protests got violent themselves. I don't support any of it but even I get news in India that Pakistan beat the people demanding freedom in muzaffarabad. Maybe both our authorities need a better training in crowd control. 

The art of data is simple it looks just like you present it. Rates of amry men commiting crimes are per their density in both countries won't be a good sight to see. Nobody talks about how many people suffered because of terrorism from Pakistan side and how many were prevented just because of the amry there. 

All I am saying is, it is not all black or white. Everyone is in the grey and because of a few extremists millions are suffering. A few photos or videos that show protest don't tell the whole story. We can be like 'I have the moral high ground'  but nobody will ever talk about the story of those guys who just want peace and love but they don't know how to raise their voice, they just keep on living, thinking that's how life is supposed to be, it is supposed to be hard.

Muslims does not care about your religion/race.
We embrace everyone. You too.

And about filling context, well BJP is doing/ will do anything to kick muslim population in their hand.

And of course to show Pakistan that India is powerful than Pakistan.
Just like they did during 1971 Pak vs Bangladesh  war.

Meanwhile Pakistan claims ownership of Kashmir, India claims ownership  of Kashmir.  Between  both countries claimings Kashmir remained helpless.

But Pakistan did not commissioned 40 thousand troops on their side of kashmir, they did not shut down kashmir for months.

But India is doing so.

India cut down communication line, did not let any international media and human rights activists enter kashmir, violated multiple UN laws. 

In case you did not know BJP is making list of people who came from another country and became citizen of India(legally). 
Why the list? To kick Muslim out.

Don't trust my words? Okay.

Search Amit Shah and muslims on youtube.

He himself said, ""We will make list of everyone who came outside of india and became citizen. We will provide full citizenship to Sikh, Christian,Hindu,Buddhist brothers""

He did not mention Muslim.  He is notorious for hating Muslims.

And thanks  to your madarchod media.
Indian media are the one who are brainwashing innocent indian people under the pressure of government. 

It is Ex Pakistani PMs,  Presidents and current Indian Ruling party who is to blame.

You may have heard of go rakhshak right?

What do they do? They kill any muslim carrying cow or cow meat.

Yes I Understand thay Cow is compared to mother in hindu religion.  I have no issues for that. You are free to practice your belief.

But.
Does geeta says to kill any Muslim who carries beef?

It is your religion that says cows are comoared to mother not their.
Does your religion teaches you to kill?

I know it is not.

Who is behind spreading this kind of hatred?

Your illiterate PM who did not go to school, does not know how the world runs and his BJP party.

f4x52b9,t1_f4vkvpw,"1. Debt is not necessarily a bad thing and US debt is relatively well managed. Not all debt is bad. There is a concept called ""financial leverage"". Basically you borrow an amount at 1% interest and earn 2% on it, you are making profit. And if you have the opportunity to take good debt like that, you are leaving money on the table by not doing it. The US govt takes on debt because it is meant to invest in the growth of their economy. And so far it has not been too shabby about servicing that debt. It's still working out flin their favour by far.

2. Economic relations go two ways. China needs access to the US market more than the US needs access to Chinese manufacturing. Don't get me wrong, a break in trade relations would be devastating for both. But it would be worse for China, no contest. The US market composes 25% of the WORLD's GDP. China is 9%. The USD is 75% of the world's ForEx reserves. RMB is 2%. The US can manufacture elsewhere, it will be expensive but not impossible. If China decides to do the trade equivalent of nuclear war, the first party to benefit will be India. Then the next will be Vietnam, Indonesia, Thailand, Bangladesh. Then Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia. The US will probably even prefer to manufacture in Mexico, a huge quantity of auto manufacturing is already done there and it's extremely effective.",4,7,1571862528.0

The country is also represented by the north cowbelt internationally, which is why people meme indians a lot and give us a bad name when we go outside.

From whatever i can understand from the modia, TMC and mamata is plain nasty and violent. There maybe some truth to it. Im surprised there arent any new political parties coming up if people are disatisfied with the TMC. Very odd congress doesnt even exist there. I can understand why people no longer trust the CPM though. Why is the TMC even pandering to the irritating and disgusting islamic mullahs ? Muslims only vote between the tmc,cpm,bjp and independant. They dont have much of a choice in the matter in the end. Nobody should pander to the fanatics of any religion, at the very least not so openly and directly to the point the other communities feel threatened.

I wonder whether people even realize the PM they have voted for is an actual clinical psychopath. Just looking at his facial expressions and his eyes tells you something is seriously wrong with him, apart from his past actions and rumours. Psychopaths knows how to control the people in the most charismatic manner without any remorse, and understands the base desires of an average human.
