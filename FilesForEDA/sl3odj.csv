hvpd375,t3_sl3odj,"Pfft, I felt far safer in Karachi than any major city in the US, even in the middle of the night. Even if you went to Sohrab Goth or a random dhaaba or hitchhiked back home. I wouldn't stay out past dark anywhere downtown in the US if I can help it unless it's a small city/town or I have a very specific plan with friends or family. Everyone else treats it the same way. People flee to their homes at night because it's not worth dealing with what might happen.

It's insanity otherwise, because literally the only one around are drunks and crazies and people visibly traumatized and abandoned who have no place else to go. You can't wear sandals because there's glass on the street everywhere from people throwing bottles. It smells like piss every other place, which may not be unusual in Karachi either some places, but fuck I don't know what they're eating but it's pungent. This obsession people have with the abroads is massively overblown. Whatever it makes up for in 'stability' it compensates for in expense and a constant ratrace, and it's just as corrupt, but the corruption is legalized.

When people in the west make judgements of Asian countries they do it from a perspective of what they have, but worse, thinking that poorer means more desperate, more willing to turn to crime and hurting someone for the sake of it because you've been pushed out of a community that only cares if you're a hyperproductive worker. There is nothing else but work and recovery from work in the west (maybe less so in Europe), and counterculture as a commodity for people who're fed up. Burnouts are discarded. For someone already suffering in Pakistan it'd probably be a dream come true to be able to afford a decent blue collar job, but for the life of me I don't get why anyone who isn't rich enough to live well anywhere in the world they choose, in which case it doesn't matter where they live, would move here. It's a shitshow. Maybe in the 90's. Not anymore. It's just FOMO from that one uncle or cousin or aunt who 'got out'.",0,18,1644073403.0

Anyone else who wants to look up crime stats avoid the site numbeo. It was the first one I looked at (cuz itâ€™s high on Google), but then it turns out their methodology is entirely how visitors felt about going to the city and then went onto the website and self-reported.

Edit: something just popped in my head. I will admit I donâ€™t know how the Lahore murder number I found was obtained. So it could be iffy there since Iâ€™m not sure about the agency that does that.  I also edited the numbers when I double checked. NYC actually had fewer murders, not more like I initially sad, but still a higher rate.",1,2,1644111614.0

You made this a race issue and that Pakistanis were being racist in comment section a few hours ago? Now a U turn with why are they so concerned over one post? You do realise that this isn't just one post, it's sample of hundreds of thousands of comments Indians leave.

But Why are you so pressed with few people's opinions? Presssed so much that you commented twice in span of few hours and God knows how many times you returned to this post. How much free time dude?

I'm more wary of the police than anyone else frankly. nowadays I'd have a car but I didn't for years and I've had police men proposition me twice when I was walking to a taxi stand or crossing at night. It's a huge city and everything works on the basis of connections, it's hard to get away with crime if you're targetting regular customers of your own community. This idea that Sohrab goth and Lyari and other places are lawless hubs of crime and violence is overblown.
