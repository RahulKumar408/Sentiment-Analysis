he was pro-China in the sense that we need good relations with our neighbours if we want peace and prosperity in our own land. he also wanted us to learn some things from China, like focus on long term planning, poverty alleviation initiatives, industrialisation, etc.

> Were previous leaders pro-USA

all of them were either pro-USA or at least wanting to be in the bad books of USA, except the founding fathers (Jinnah, Liaqat Ali Khan).

> his win angered them?

yes, because he was anti-US foreign policy. US policy in Afghanistan was a disaster for Afghanistan and Pakistan. he didnt want to give them airbases after US left Afghanistan. also USA is anti-China, and Imran Khan doesnt want USA to make Pakistan anti-China because its not good for Pakistan's peace and prosperity. 

> Is Pakistan pro-China now?

if you put a gun to peoples head and asked them to choose who to be closer to, China or USA, most would pick China because we will gain more from them since they are our neighbours. China has also done more for us than USA has ever done. we dont want to be pawns of the USA in their war against China, and we dont like USA's foreign policy ideas for Pakistan because its not going to help us in the long term.

> China will just take your infrastructure in lieu of the installments, like they have done so many times in the African countries - would that still be preferable to the IMF?

we owe more money to USA than China. at least China is willing to restructure our loans unlike USA, and everyone knows IMF is controlled by USA.",1,2,1650060003.0
