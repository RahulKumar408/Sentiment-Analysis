-   Displacement of a large portion of the IVC population to South India during the 2nd millienium BC, which can only happen forcefully.

-  Displacement of IVC language, widespread use of Indo-Aryan languages in North India after Steppe invasion that brought Indo European languages

-    Hindu caste system which is extremely endogamous provides genetic proof of Aryans dominating South Asian populations. Brahmins and Kshtriyas, who form the ruling classes have high Aryan/Steppe ancestry. This only comes from invasion and subjugation, since these classes are at the top of the caste system and formed the ruling elite in India for more than 2000 years.

-   History of documented Aryan/Central Asian invasions into India from the north east of India, from the Huns to the Mughals. Those were not ''peaceful migrations'. On what basis should we assume the prior invasions in prehistory were 'migrations' and not 'invasions'?

2) My biggest argument is that the Aryans did not just ""migrate"" into India peacefully during the decline of IVC, peaceful migrations into populated areas by foreign groups 4000 years ago is not plausible. Aryans invaded, conquered, and that's why we speak a language that is connected to other areas of the world where this group went. Maybe a lot of the nomad Central Asia groups did ""migrate"", migration happens especially with herds, but India is not a grassland for Central Asian herders. it's most likely that Steppe nomads continued to trickle in after the initial wave of conquest. 

3) I agree with your hypothesis that Brahminism was formed in India, however I also know what study you quote. However the problem with quoting non-Brahmin admixtures is that because those groups are more exogamous. Gujjars for example are nomads, and Jatt (and even Rajput) are more flexible identities with a large umbrella, and have been so for at least 2 or 3 hundred years now. 

I don't understand what you are replying to, I cited that Steppe Ancestry is higher in Brahmins across the board which shows that this elite class either formed with the Aryan invasion or soon after it. The fact that some West North India populations have more Steppe admixture than even Brahmins, could be due to a host of factors, including consistent migration into NW India from Central Asia over the centuries.

Pretty much all evidence points to an invasion, not a migration. Migration is just a politically correct way of saying invasion/subjugation. Much like the European ""migration"" into North America.  

1. Displacement of a large portion of the IVC population to South India during the 2nd millienium BC, which can only happen forcefully. 

2. Displacement of IVC language, widespread use of Indo-Aryan languages in North India after Steppe invasion that brought Indo European languages

3. Hindu caste system which is extremely endogamous provides genetic proof of Aryans dominating South Asian populations. Brahmins and Kshtriyas, who form the ruling classes have high Aryan/Steppe ancestry. This only comes from invasion and subjugation, since these classes are at the top of the caste system and formed the ruling elite in India for more than 2000 years. 

4. History of documented Aryan/Central Asian invasions into India from the north east of India, from the Huns to the Mughals. Those were not ''peaceful migrations'.

g176k52,t1_g171gjk,"Pakistanis and all South Asians as a whole share genetics with Iranians. Iranians are primarily a mixture of Iranian Neolithic Farmers and Anatolian Farmers with some Steppe\_MLBA (what you would call Aryan) and Caucasian Hunter Gatherer and very minimal amounts of AASE and Northeast Asian. The more South and East you go in Iran, the less Anatolian Farmer and more Steppe and AASE, and some southern parts of Iran have variable amounts of Subsaharan African ancestry. All South Asians are fundamentally a mixture of Iranian Neolithic Farmers, AASE, and Steppe MLBA. The more South and East you go, people have more AASE (and in the far Eastern parts of India, people, of course, have elevated East Asian ancestry). Pakistanis and certain North Indians like Greater Punjabis, certain Rajasthanis, Kashmiris, etc. being the most Northwestern South Asians, have the most Iranian Neolithic in the subcontinent, but some groups in India such as certain Patels in Gujarat can be particularly rich with Iranian Neolithic as well.

The main difference between modern Iranians and modern South Asian groups is that Iranians have significant amounts of direct Anatolian Farmer that they gained during the Chalcolithic period; whereas, most South Asians (including even Pashtuns) don't have anywhere near as much consistently on average, and whatever Anatolian Farmer South Asians do have was most likely gained from Steppe\_MLBA. And of course, the vast majority Iranians have very little to none AASE ancestry; whereas, it's a major ancestral component for South Asians. In fact, most Iranians live in the Northern and Western parts of Iran where there is not much AASE at all and can be practically considered to be virtually none.

Obviously yes, the individuals who act like Iranians and Pakistanis are the ""same"" are pretty annoying, but they also are a very small minority. However, there are concrete scientific genetic relationships between Iranians and South Asians as a whole, which is harbored by both groups sharing significant Iranian Neolithic ancestry. There are obviously substantial differences, but there are also enough similarities for us to ascribe a deep relationship.",6,3,1597225771.0

Aryans were conquerors, people denying it are just politically motivated.

g1f5v9o,t1_g1evopi,"I still consider myself far from even an amateur in this field considering it is highly technical and requires years of specialized studying/training. However, I do study this field albeit all vaguely at this point as delving into the advanced side of this subject requires a lot of upper level CS, mathematics, biology, etc. which I am still studying concurrently (I am a physics major, was a former math/CS major at some point though). The information I have told you is far from even a glimpse into the surface of the subject's meat and potatoes. 

With Anatolian Turks (The ethnic Turks/Turkish people of Turkey), their genetic admixture varies depending on region and tribe/group of origin, but broadly speaking they are mostly Anatolian Farmer (which is maximized in Sardinians) with some Caucasian Hunter Gatherer, Iranian Neolithic Farmer, Levantine Neolithic and they have a variable Steppe component that is the highest in the Northern and Western parts, and lowest in the Eastern/Southern parts but this is not always a given as some Anatolian Turks could have ancestry from the Balkans, who like all Europeans have a lot more Steppe than Middle Eastern groups such as the average Anatolian Turks. Nonetheless, the Steppe in Turks fundamentally derives from a similar source as the Steppe in ethnic groups living in the Balkans so it has to be from the pre-Turkic expansion era and not from any Central Asian group as Central Asian groups carry the same type of Steppe of South Asians primarily (Sintashta MLBA), and Turks also score the highest Steppe in West Asia next to Northeast Caucasian groups such as Chechens. Iranians, Levantine/Gulf Arabs, Georgians/South-Ossetians, for example, score much less Steppe than most South Asians from Pakistan and Northwestern India on average, especially the ones after Iranians. The component that Central Asians did bring into Turkey/Anatolia, a relatively significant amount of for Western Asia (the Middle East), was a combination of Northeast Asian and Siberian, or we can just collectively refer to these two into some kind of Northeastern Eurasian. I believe Turks in Western and Central Turkey have the most Northeastern Eurasian, and Turks in Eastern Turkey have the least, contrary to what most people may superficially assume. This Northeastern Eurasian was brought in by Turkmen from what is now Turkmenistan. Some Turks can be modeled as almost 50% Greek and 50% Turkmenistani Turkmen. 

So that's Turks. I can go a lot more in detail but you would have to message on the chat with me, and I could give some rough numbers regarding these admixtures, but it will take a while.",8,1,1597391933.0
