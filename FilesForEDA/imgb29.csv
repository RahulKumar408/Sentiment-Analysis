g40yydx,t1_g40y2ej,"Yeah no doubt this is rushed but that's what updates are for I guess.

They could have based it on 1000+ titles but none of them feature so many characters, each with their own fighting mechanics, skill trees, levels, gear, special moves and missions.

Take captain america for example, what could they have based him on? Or Ms marvel or black widow. Iron man is ok-ish and the hulk could have been better.

I really hope they fix the game mechanics. I don't give two shits about graphics, if the game has a good story and game mechanics, I'll play it.",7,2,1599246499.0

People are upset this time because exclusive content in a multiplatform game is just bad for everyone and it's not one character, it's fking Spider-Man.
