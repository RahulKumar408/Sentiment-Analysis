hhrdech,t3_qe0eki,"Cringe af. This is such a stupid af take, you children don't know what the hell you're talking about most of the time. Overseas Pakistanis still have friends and family back home. They don't live in a bubble. They're falling over themselves to marry their kids to a nice bacha from Pakistan. They read and write Urdu more than locals do and have some sort of news on 24/7. They sent back 29.4 BILLION dollars in remittances this year to said friends and family. That number represents most of the country's foreign reserves. It would literally be worse in Pakistan right now if it wasn't for overseas Pakistanis because remittances are at an all-time high, nearly double. 

You morons think MQM's torture cells were better, even a start? Was it fun when factory workers showed up murdered in pieces in jute bags because the owner refused to continue paying protection money to them? Have you ever had goons show up to your door to tell you how to vote? Or had Zardari's minions tell you you have to move and sell your house because they're expanding Bilawal house into a presidential palace? Have you ever been robbed, told someone connected who happened to call to ask how you were and then had police hand deliver you your wallet after a week saying 'they recovered it'?

Imran Khan may be stupid and incompetent in a lot of ways, but *he's not looking to kill you because your land or business looks tasty*. He's not some feudal prick, or even some aspirational feudal lord turned politician. He doesn't have a favorite village or district or literal gang he's pulling minions from and funneling millions to. He's just some ass who used to play cricket, that frankly most of you ten years ago would have been falling over to compliment despite being an ass. You're bitching about your choices when *you have none* and you just don't want to be told what to do. The most Pakistani habit of all, having some stupid nukta you won't shut up about and won't be told to let go. Half this sub complains about hurr durr libs/burgers/elites not representing the country when you probably read and write less urdu than most overseas Pakistanis who make it a point to be educated in their culture and don't know a lick about your government or how it actually rules.

The first complete civilian transfer of government in this country was in 2013. For 66 years it was fucked with. 14% increase in the global money supply, transport costs globally at an all time high, supply chain disruptions all over the world, a global pandemic, ZOMG all IK's fault. Containers that used to cost 4000 dollars to transport are now 50k, if you can get them. I'm not some PTI fanboi, I'd rather he have lent his political capital to a statesman, but it's moronic the amounts of bitching and whining you hear. Of course, taxes will go up, of course your currency will be devalued, your country produces barely anything and has massive expenses that don't magically disappear with any administration. X days to corruption free! So what if it's not immediately true? Are you 5? Do you think you're ordering food? This is the first thing resembling a non-establishment politician we've had. You'd need ten or twenty years of this for substantial change. 

Social media and resentment is rotting your brain. *Better doesn't mean easier*. Half the things that used to go on in Pakistan would curdle your scrotes, and you slept through it, and weren't capable of doing anything but bitch then too. Do most of you even know who your mayor is? Who your union council members are? What ward you're in? If the police come after you unlawfully, do you know to call for example the Ombudsman? Do you even know what an ombudsman is? Do you participate in your government at all or do you just learn BS regurgitated American conservative political spectrum shit off Indian twitter like a human centipede of bad ideas and call it a day? What you need is a r/canconfirmiamindian so you can live your life's aspirations bitching about ABCD's and turning into uncles who yell over each other as conversation every time they meet.

What we lack is civic engagement and agency and actually seeing our problems and this sort of bitching is a distraction. There's a generation of educated, well informed, dedicated career civil servants that disappeared from government over the last 66 years. CSS candidates are falling year over year, apart from a brief uptick in 2020. It was 36k in 2015, and it's 18k now. If you know better, you *could* apply and be of service. If you can't do that you could try and participate anyway, like most of the world does. You're sitting getting khwaar online talking smack and politics, not knowing a lick about the sort of problems the country has and how deep they run. 

Container prices have tripled or quintupled in the pandemic, sorry, your tomatoes are going to be more expensive. You know what would help? Following up on canning units: 

http://www.agripunjab.gov.pk/system/files/01-Fruit%20and%20Vegetable%20Canning%201.pdf

We're one of very few countries that don't have extensive infrastructure for local canning, and the government hasn't followed up on these initiatives. Canning has an incredible effect on the price of vegetables, because you can grow more when the yields are highest for your particular crop, and wind up with a high quality nutritionally dense food product that's indefinitely shelf stable and that stabilizes your prices as a result. In fact, the world over, canned tomatoes are usually higher quality than getting tomatoes from the grocery store off season. It's a known, not highly technical solution, could do a lot of good, and has a local manufacturing base already, it just needs to be expanded and coordinated with You can call your local agricultural authorities and ask them what they need to get more of these initiatives off the ground. Would you know that's even an option if you haven't even bothered to look for solutions?

Tomatoes are a water thirsty crop, but they're high yield, so planting them all at once actually conserves things like water and curbs pesticide/fertilizer use instead of planting them all year and hoping for the best. Cooler times of the year mean less bugs and disease and rot. We actually get rainfall at a great time of year for tomatoes.

Did you know PTI and other parties in cooperation with them brought new laws to regulate water/irrigation for farming and it's supply, which hadn't been updated since 1873? These communities have waited forever for someone to even notice or follow through on feudal buffoons who controlled their access to water, and regulate settlements made along canals. Even if the law isn't perfect, at least someone is *bothering* to do something about it: 

https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/790978-punjab-irrigation-minister-reveals-pti-govts-agricultural-reforms-farmer-rights

Maybe they could form a cooperative, like across the world, where farmer coops come together and coordinate their yields and irrigation and lobby for reform? Whoops, the Cooperative Societies Act of 1925 was only just significantly amended in 2020. I myself have been trying to start coops in other sectors off and on for nearly a decade, and there's no incentives, help or guidance, and very few people have enough experience to tell you what works outside of housing. And only now, considering farmer's coops are one of the staple political blocs across the world, and Pakistan should rightfully have one of the largest ever, is the government and media doing anything to actively educate and promote cooperatives amongst them: https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2021/10/17/the-need-for-farmer-cooperatives-in-pakistan/

Instead we've been steadily cutting into local farmers with reforms that decimate local industries in favor of larger business interests:
https://grain.org/en/article/6738-the-corporate-attack-on-pakistan-s-small-dairies

The investment is coming in now because the country is seen as more stable, and there are obviously underserved markets, but none of the local players can participate besides a select few, they can't afford to, and that both kills most of the local farmer's production, requires more spending to build up privately infrastructure that the public will have to subsidize eventually when we have to spend into the deficit it causes when large industrial farmers literally can't keep up with the demand because they killed most of the supply with laws that suit them and carve out their market to the detriment of others. 

Guess what happens when local farmers are strapped for cash because they're already cutting into their profits to process their goods? The price goes up massively, and they still don't earn enough to ramp up supply because they have no access to capital.

What stroke of the pen would solve this over even a decade if most of the country has no clue that it's happening? Farmers are wary of coops because they think it means losing control over their property, and they're right to be afraid, digitizing land records is a new initiative that nobody wanted or put their weight behind til recently. You're seeing people surge to the cities with their illgotten wealth because of it. Eventually they'll be taxed. You'd have to be some kind of stupid to think it'll fix itself overnight after 60 to 70 odd years of insanity, and still more day to day complications.",0,91,1635009425.0

hhr1zse,t3_qe0eki,"Someone explain to me how is an Overseas Pakistani defined by you lot on here? The law of the land defines Pakistanis who have lived outside the country for more than 6 months as Overseas Pakistani (hence they are eligible for a NICOP).  These people are still PAKISTANI, who were born/raised in Pakistan, have Pakistani passports, and have to file tax returns in Pakistan (legally at least). 

Many on here seem to be putting OPs in the same basket as people of Pakistani Origin. These are people who were born and raised outside by OPs (so 2nd/3rd gen), and have completely different citizenship, mentality and all that. 

So technically, wth is wrong with being an Overseas Pakistani and commenting on the country you are a citizen of? I am asking as one. The constitution still applies to me, my residence is not determining my Pakistaniat. And if thats the logic, if I move back to Lahore tomorrow then am I Pakistani all of a sudden again? Lol what is that logic...then whats the point to having a citizenship at all just make all those living in Pak as Pakistani and the moment you cross the borders you are not Pakistani anymore.

Every Pakistani feels like they know more, this is not an overseas problem.

I am an OP who has actively decided not to be a dual citizen, for my own personal reasons. But I don't see anything wrong with dual nationality. 9/10 Pakistanis don't pay taxes (everyone, citizen or noncitizen, pays indirect taxes when traveling in Pakistan, so no reason to argue with that). They are drawing representation without participation...that in my head is absolutely wrong. So pointing fingers at a small minority living outside, vs the millions who get to vote without contributing anything is a bullshit argument.

Easy ho ja bhai, parhna seekh le. Wouldn't call them overseas PAKISTANI if we didn't want them to be a part of us. Nobody is talking about stripping any nationalities, you asked for what we think an OP is and I gave you my opinion. Being an OP isn't a formal thing, it just means you're outside Pakistan. If you're looking for an argument then let me know and I can indulge you otherwise ek dafa phir parh lo aur baat karo.

>Every Pakistani feels like they know more

Evidently so.

>You could also then keep on going and say the rich should not vote for the poor, what does a rich person know about economic stress?

Absolute idiocracy. Everyone is equal in the eyes of the ballot, every person gets an equal say - regardless of colour or bank balance.

>Or the Sindhi should not vote for a Pashtun, because what does a Sindhi know about KP? Thats not how the world works sir, democracy mein sab ki suni jaati hai as long as the law applies

LMAO, a Sindhi def does not vote for a Pathan. Pehle khud seekh lo how democracy works LMFAOOOO. This is exactly why people diss OPs XD

>And the law applies to OPs

Yea and I'm advocating for changing the law like many other countries. As for now, OPs can vote and I don't have a problem with that.

>I am an OP who has actively decided not to be a dual citizen, for my own personal reasons. But I don't see anything wrong with dual nationality.

I can tell you live abroad, it is very clear to see. And I respect your opinion.

>9/10 Pakistanis don't pay taxes

Ok thank you for bringing in an irrelevant thing. Much obliged.

>so no reason to argue with that

Damn you really want to argue so bad, go ahead and read it again and remind me where I make that claim?

>So pointing fingers at a small minority living outside

huh? Who is? Show me where I wag the finger at your kind.

>vs the millions who get to vote without contributing anything is a bullshit argument

Absolutely false. Anyone living in Pakistan is directly contributing to our economy. Every person who gets enough food to stay alive is contributing to our economy, if he pays for the food or if someone pays for him. Indirect taxes as you said.

>Another point here is that you have million of illiterate people voting in the current system

Oh yes let's make disabled people second rate citizens as well haina? Are you ok buddy? Are you drunk? What are you smoking? How did you draw all these conclusions from my comment? I hope for your sake you're an imaginative person otherwise please get yourself checked.

I used your own argument. According to you, because OPs don't live in Pakistan, they are barely  aware of the situation on the ground, so they shouldn't vote. I simply wanted to say that Sindh doesn't know shit about KP, and KP doesn't know shit about Sindh, but they both vote for the same federal government.
