gw99nf7,t3_n0jf6o,"I see all other cities and states giving their 110% to contain corona meanwhile here in Karachi our govt is like ""ja simran jee le apni zindagi"". There is no restrictions being imposed, no SOPs are being followed, all markets are opened and people are breathing directly into each other mouths. Had to go to market a few days ago for EID clothes, trust me when i tell u i don't remember anyone wearing a mask, other than us. The shopkeeper had mask but they had it pulled down to their neck so they can talk easily. i'm afraid shit is about to hit the fan in a few days and we will again be sitting in our homes. I beleieve they've already announced lockdown for Eid. By God this city has been dealt the worse hand in the country.",0,14,1619667708.0
