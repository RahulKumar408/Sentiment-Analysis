jwzn1on,t3_15w6qdy,"Brief context:

The Official Secrets Amendment Bill of 2023 and the Pakistan Army Amendment Bill received approval from both the National Assembly and the Senate. Subsequently, they were forwarded to the President for his approval.

Yesterday, news broke that the President had signed the bills into law.

However, in this tweet today, the President announced that he had not signed the bills. He had directed his staff to return the bills instead. The President's tweet insinuates that his staff disregarded his instructions by not returning the bills within time.

According to the Constitution, the President can return a bill twice to the Parliament for reconsideration. The bill must be returned within the provided timeframe, otherwise it would be considered as approved by the President.

It's important to note that the country is presently without an elected assembly and is being governed by a caretaker administration. Generally, this means that any returned bill will await reconsideration until the next elected assembly convenes, after the General Elections.",0,27,1692534753.0

I suspect many people don’t understand the full significance of what has happened. 

If this can happen to the president, then the whole bureaucracy is untrustworthy. The prime minister cannot trust the civil servants under him. Same for the ministers, and chief ministers, senators. Anyone may swap out the wording of one bill or summary just before it has to be signed. Possibly whole lot of other stuff.
