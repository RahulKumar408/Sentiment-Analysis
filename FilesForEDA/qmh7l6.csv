hja5jhe,t3_qmh7l6,"Guys, at the end of the day, don't be hateful and enjoy the culture and aesthetics of different religions. The Prophet (SAW) was extremely fond of the Abyssinian customs (who were Christians mind you) and he did not prevent people from worshipping neither did he demean them (may Allah raise his noble rank). He even stood up for a Jew's funeral. I have different friends of other faiths; we do discuss about religion but respectfully and we appreciate and respect the other's religion.  The Prophet (SAW) was extremely merciful to people of other faith (but his mercy did not extend to those who broke the rules and violated rights, be it the Quraysh or Banu Quraydah). The world would be a better place if we were to do that.",0,54,1636033949.0

hjdn3cp,t1_hjc0dtc,"Thats simply not true. Pakistan was created to cater to a Muslim population and provide a safe haven to them, putting an end to persecution of Muslims and the political disadvantages they faced in Hindu majority British India. It wasn't really based off of establishing Shariah law or envisioning a pure Muslim state with no other minority group. The white in our flag literally represents the minorities. Jinnah said that everyone will be free to practice their own religion in this new country which was supposed to be free from all kinds of persecution in the speech he gave. Nobody ever said that Pakistan's sole purpose was creating an Islamic state that upholds Shariah Law. It was just a platform and a home to Muslims (as a people, not as a religion) of the sub-continent in which they would decide what they wanted to do and what laws they wanted to implement. Your argument is actually the same argument used by Indian nationalists to delegitimise the formation of Pakistan. It is clearly flawed.",5,6,1636087038.0

hjcak2g,t1_hjc8flk,Ffs what did I do? I'm not a secular rather a practising Muslim myself but we got people proving what religious extremism does to them...sad innit :(,7,1,1636064422.0
hjgq3he,t1_hjc8flk,"Greeting the kuffaar on Christmas and other religious holidays of theirs is haraam, by consensus, as Ibn al-Qayyim, may Allaah have mercy on him, said in Ahkaam Ahl al-Dhimmah: ""Congratulating the kuffaar on the rituals that belong only to them is haraam by consensus, as is congratulating them on their festivals and fasts by saying ‘A happy festival to you’ or ‘May you enjoy your festival,’ and so on. If the one who says this has been saved from kufr, it is still forbidden. It is like congratulating someone for prostrating to the cross, or even worse than that. It is as great a sin as congratulating someone for drinking wine, or murdering someone, or having illicit sexual relations, and so on. Many of those who have no respect for their religion fall into this error; they do not realize the offensiveness of their actions. Whoever congratulates a person for his disobedience or bid’ah or kufr exposes himself to the wrath and anger of Allaah.""  
  
Congratulating the kuffaar on their religious festivals is haraam to the extent described by Ibn al-Qayyim because it implies that one accepts or approves of their rituals of kufr, even if one would not accept those things for oneself. But the Muslim should not aceept the rituals of kufr or congratulate anyone else for them, because Allaah does not accept any of that at all, as He says (interpretation of the meaning):  
""If you disbelieve, then verily, Allaah is not in need of you, He likes not disbelief for His slaves. And if you are grateful (by being believers), He is pleased therewith for you. . ."" \[al-Zumar 39:7\]  
"". . . This day, I have perfected your religion for you, completed My favour upon you, and have chosen for you Islaam as your religion . . ."" \[al-Maa’idah 5:3\]  
So congratulating them is forbidden, whether they are one’s colleagues at work or otherwise.  
If they greet us on the occasion of their festivals, we should not respond, because these are not our festivals, and because they are not festivals which are acceptable to Allaah. These festivals are innovations in their religions, and even those which may have been prescribed formerly have been abrogated by the religion of Islaam, with which Allaah sent Muhammad (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) to the whole of mankind. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):  
""Whoever seeks a religion other than Islaam, it will never be accepted of him, and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers."" \[Aal ‘Imraan 3:85\]  
It is haraam for a Muslim to accept invitations on such occasions, because this is worse than congratulating them as it implies taking part in their celebrations.

  
Similarly, Muslims are forbidden to imitate the kuffaar by having parties on such occasions, or exchanging gifts, or giving out sweets or food, or taking time off work, etc., because the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: ""Whoever imitates a people is one of them."" Shaykh al-Islaam Ibn Taymiyah said in his book Iqtidaa’ al-siraat al-mustaqeem mukhaalifat ashaab al-jaheem: ""Imitating them in some of their festivals implies that one is pleased with their false beliefs and practices, and gives them the hope that they may have the opportunity to humiliate and mislead the weak.""  
Whoever does anything of this sort is a sinner, whether he does it out of politeness or to be friendly, or because he is too shy to refuse, or for whatever other reason, because this is hypocrisy in Islaam, and because it makes the kuffaar feel proud of their religion.  
Allaah is the One Whom we ask to make the Muslims feel proud of their religion, to help them adhere steadfastly to it, and to make them victorious over their enemies, for He is the Strong and Omnipotent.
