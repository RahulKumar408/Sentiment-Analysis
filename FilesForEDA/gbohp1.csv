Aa far as people of other faiths are concerned, they should be treated with utmost respect and honor as they are required to.

So ? Rangers Punjab are nearly 100% Punjabi.

Rangers Sindh are 100% Sindhi.

>Most of Artillery regiment has 30-35% pathans, Armour regiments have mostly pathan class serving in them. Every other corp/ regiment have atleast 10-20% pathan representation.

fp9ou3q,t1_fp9ofdc,"First of all, what will be accepted and what will not is only decided by Allah. Secondly you are comparing apples to oranges. Also, did you even read the answer in the link you yourself posted?


Here you go, your own link:

'..whether a person combines the entire phrase, “inshallah,” or puts one or two spaces, “insha Allah” “in sha Allah,” all these forms are permissible. This point is even clearer to those who have researched the transformation of the Arabic writing style (or any language for that matter) throughout the ages.[1] In every era, scribes wrote Quran and Hadith based on the style prevalent in their age and society. The same applies to the usage of diacritical marks and dots. If the permissibility of variant styles in Arabic was never contested in the history of Islam, why then should varying transliterations be contested?

As far as the claim that if one writes “inshaAllah”/ “inshallah” it will mean “create Allah,” this is incorrect. Firstly, because every reader and writer understands the purport of this word formulation. Just as words having multiple meanings are interpreted/understood contextually, so too will a transliteration be understood contextually. Secondly, the verb “create” is classified as فعل الأمر (imperative verb) in Arabic. The imperative form of “create” using the root word إنشاء is أنشئ (Anshi’ with a sharp ending, unlike an alif). When the word الله is joined to the imperative أنشئ, the final letter of the imperative is given a kasrah ( ئِ ) based on the rules of morphology: أنشئ الله. Technically speaking, the transliteration should then be “anshi illah.” It is therefore incorrect to scrutinize a transliteration based on the technicalities of another language.

In light of the above, the various forms of transliteration for “insha Allah” are permissible.[2] Delving into such intricacies only brings difficulty on a person.     ",6,3,1588431366.0
fp7fcdt,t1_fp7cy2s,That is a 9 year old brief. There have been a massive recruitment drives in recent years. There weren’t many baloch serving because they were unaware of the opportunities. Now Army has a fixed quota for Baloch and Sindhi class.,6,6,1588369570.0
fp7f17f,t1_fp7ddod,"I am talking about Army, Army is a regular force recruiting from all over the country, keeping ethnic parity among its ranks, unlike the general public thinks and i am sorry to burst your bubble, Army doesn’t have a 50 percent punjabi representation. Rangers and FC are para military forces who recruit local people who know the area because most of their job/ work scope revolves around holding the borders until regular army arrives to reinforce the positions. Or like these days when they are used to maintain law and order in aid of civil power. Rangers and FC wings remain stationary so they cannot recruit people from other provinces as that would be an administrative disaster. Army units and regiments are satellite and they keep on re locating on bi yearly basis.
And I am the source of information, because i am a part of this system. My Sqn alone has 3 Sindhi, 2 Baloch, 3 Kashmiri, 3 Pathan, 1 Gilgiti and 3 Punjabi Officers, my commanding officer is a Christian, my roommate of 1 year is a christian, I myself, am a Kashmiri.
