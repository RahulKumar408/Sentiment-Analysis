fixlaf1,t3_facphh,"When I was about 10 of 12, my aunt gave me a rather soiled note to buy dahi. It was a day or two before eid so I had to buy couple kg of dahi and milk. She told me how I could slide it past shopkeeper wrapped in good notes, unnoticed.

I did that, but never went to that shop again, I felt that I had betrayed the shopkeeper. You don't do your dahi wala dirty like that. Sorry chacha ji, she made me do it!!",0,58,1582822383.0

fj5ljxe,t1_fj4vrvu,"Its about telling who posted the original to give them the credit they deserve which you are ignoring. If a person simply does not tell the members that the post has been already posted in another forum and does not cross post it then it will be plagiarism due to the fact the link to the original post is missing and it is assumed that the content is original.Plagiarism does not mean that any content if taken from else where is plagiarized but it applyies when a content you took from someone else is not given the credit.Anything which is not giving credit to the original provider is Plagiarism .Even if copy right laws do not apply here, we still need to apply them in our life's cause its sends a negative image to other people about how a society operates. In this case it show's that nobody cares about other people's property and can claim it for themselves. This is just like land grabbing in Pakistan. Finally the day the laws are brought to action, due to people's common practice of cheating/plagiarism people will be fined or even jailed over breaking laws.
