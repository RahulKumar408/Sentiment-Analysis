""From musaylimah, messenger of God, to Muhammad ‎ﷺ, Messenger of God. Salutations to you. I have been given a share with you in this matter. Half the earth belongs to us and half to the Quraish. But the Quraish are people who transgress.""

Bro, most of these people saying that they're prophets are mentally ill and not in a sane state of mind. What you're saying is not cool. Islam does not teach us to kill people with mental illnesses (like that recent guy who Mr. PseudoGhazi decided to shoot in court) who know not what they do or say.

Unlike Musaylimah though, he later repented and went on to become a ghazi and great Muslim war hero during the War against the Sassanid Persians at the Battles of Qadisiyyah and Nahawand.

Safwan reported from a number of Companions of the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) on the authority of their fathers who were relatives of each other. The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ)  said: Beware, if anyone wrongs a contracting man, or diminishes his  right, or forces him to work beyond his capacity, or takes from him  anything without his consent, I shall plead for him on the Day of  Judgment.

this is a more correct translation of the same hadith.

“Beware, if  anyone persecutes any peaceful non-Muslim citizen [Mu’ahid], or  diminishes his right, or forces him to work beyond his capacity, or  takes from him anything without his consent, I shall plead for him on  the Day of Judgment.”

Sunan Abu dawud 3052



there's also this one from sahih bukhari : https://sunnah.com/bukhari/87/52

The Prophet (ﷺ) said, ""Whoever killed a Mu'ahid (a person who is granted the pledge of protection by the  Muslims) shall not smell the fragrance of Paradise though its fragrance can be smelt at a distance of  forty years (of traveling).

حَدَّثَنَا  قَيْسُ بْنُ حَفْصٍ، حَدَّثَنَا عَبْدُ الْوَاحِدِ، حَدَّثَنَا الْحَسَنُ،  حَدَّثَنَا مُجَاهِدٌ، عَنْ عَبْدِ اللَّهِ بْنِ عَمْرٍو، عَنِ النَّبِيِّ  صلى الله عليه وسلم قَالَ ‏ ""‏ مَنْ قَتَلَ نَفْسًا مُعَاهَدًا لَمْ يَرَحْ رَائِحَةَ الْجَنَّةِ، وَإِنَّ رِيحَهَا يُوجَدُ مِنْ مَسِيرَةِ أَرْبَعِينَ عَامًا ‏""‏‏.‏  Reference : Sahih al-Bukhari 6914


This hadith is about non muslim citizens.

How we should treat them.

How to deal with non muslims


Edit :Changed the link(If you have a better article please do share!).

I would like to add that A mu'ahid isn't a dhimmi, a dhimmi is someone who pays jizzya.

While a mu'ahid is simply a contractor who accepted to live in muslim land (he still has to pay a tax). Both their lives, property and honnour are to be protected.

Unfortunatly I couldn't find many article about the subject in english by muslims.

When did I imply in my post that they weren't going to kill him? Tulayha was literally at war with them during the Ridda Wars so of course, they wanted to kill him. You kill your enemies at war, not go around giving them hugs. 

Also, him being able to enter Umar ibn al-Khattab's presence and being given a chance to repent by Umar which Tulayha subsequently took was itself an opportunity that he was given. 

Judging by the way u/UsmanSaleemS is talking, however, it seems Umar should have killed Tulayha the moment he came into his presence and given him no chance to repent.

Allah has granted humanity the wisdom to contemplate and exercise basic common sense. It is illogical for Islam to promote the requirement of four witnesses for an act of rape, and even out of the blue they required four witnesses, wouldn't they do something to stop the rape and if they didn't, won't  they be illegible to stand as witnesses as Islam stresses the people of pity and exemplary faith can stand out as such in context of Zina?

This would seem unfair and an oppression against the victim, to bring out the requirement of witnesses, it is as if she is punished for something beyond her control.

And regarding Ahmedis being bigger problem I'll try to explain it with an example let say X is a person and I ( who is not his son ) go out and do crimes and when someone asks me who is your father I will say X is my father and i will go out start spreading rumors about X that he's an pedo, alcoholic and all the bad stuff but when I'm brought in front of X and asked is he your son?

""The Pen does not record (evil actions) against the sleeper until he awakes, or against the boy until he reaches puberty, or against the madman until he recovers his wits."" (Al-Hujwiri, *The Kashf al Mahjub*, 35I.)

According to that hadith then (which you'll probably call fake because it doesn't fit your agenda), an insanity defence then exists under the sharia for the mentally ill. If you still think it's okay to take the law into your own hands and go about murdering the mentally ill in the streets (who cannot be held responsible for their acts under the Sharia including any acts of blasphemy like the ones Tahir Nadeem committed), then you are clearly a jahil extremist whose actions serve no purpose but to break Islamic law and tarnish our noble faith's reputation like Mumtaz Qadri and those villains in Daesh did.  

Also, you claim that the Prophet's companions would not have hesitated at all to attack someone who claimed or was though to be Dajjal and yet, the case of  [Saf ibn Sayyad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saf_ibn_Sayyad) shows otherwise. In his childhood, he claimed to be a prophet and was thought to be the Dajjal and yet the Prophet and his Companions left him in peace. Later, when he grew up, he then repented and became a practicing Muslim. According to you, however, the Sahaba should have disobeyed the Prophet's command to leave him be and killed him, thus not giving Ibn Sayyad the chance to repent.

Finally, you claim that I (and likely others such as u/warhea) bring in evidence that contradicts our positions.

Let's say I found a hadeeth along the lines of ""whoever seeks to exclude others from a group that he has self identified with based on his beliefs is causing harm to those following their own ""misguided"" beliefs"" 

If I were a follower of Xa, and you that of X, I could just as well call you out as not a true believer of X, as in my mind I would be the ""true"" part of the X group and those evil others like you would need to be stopped.

So ok we should call them Shia Muslim. That’s the constitutional right and not just that, being a Muslim we should be polite enough to call people with the identity they like. Bhai like to be called bhai Muslims so we must call them that. Christians liked to be called Massihi in so we should call them that. Wahabis liked to be called Ahal Hadith or salafi so we should, deo bandis liked that so we do, some liked to be called sunnies so we do, We are Muslims and liked to be called Muslims so we should.

We believe Ahmadi Muslims are none Muslims because they have started a whole knew ummah and declared all Muslims as Kufar and none Muslims to them. This is their mistake we will teach every generation and we will keep preachin Ahmadi Muslims their mistake as well.

In the meanwhile when we talk to them they liked to be called Ahmadi Muslims so we will call them the name they have chosen for themselves, we won't call them Pervaizi, kadyani, kafar, murtad or anything in between, because that will hurt them and they will never open to see what mistake they have made.

Even prophet cannot call anyone Al Kafir or Al Mushrik the day one because he cannot see peoples hearts, only Allah can. Then the time came Mekkans were declared Al kufar from Allah and hence they were punished. Then same happened with the Jews and Christians and all countries Prophet sent letters.

g1dep1x,t1_g1d3xgd,"That's the thing my dear it’s a matter of having the right and authority. That’s my question to you, who has the right and authority to do so? Or is it because it’s so obvious then everyone and anyone can, should must do it?

Let give you a simple example, for instance, you see a man killed someone with the eyes of your head in the day time that you could recognize this person even from 100 yards or a mile.

Do you then have a right to call him a murderer or are you an authority to declare him a cold-hearted killer? 

Most certainly you cannot, even though you have not the slightest doubt he is the murderer.

The only right you have is to file a report for him.

The court will do the trial and declare it as first-degree cold-blooded murder or an accident.

If it’s an accident, even then you won’t have any right to call the person a murderer. Because he is not guilty. Yours eyes cannot judge him anymore, if you will insiste that would be felony against the decision of court.

If he is declared a murderer and given a punishment then you may call him a murderer but it would not be necessary to call the person murderer like forever. Because even a murderer can repent and change do toubah, You won't be a polite person if you must call him a murderar Muslims are always polite. 

Now my dear Shirk, bidah, Kufar, Irtadad, are one of the utter sins and when Allah sends a prophet in any nation they also become the utter crimes. Only Allah has the right and authority to punish any human or nation on committing those sin/crimes during the time of prophet or on judgement day. He then gives this right and authority to his Prophet for a little time to give this punishment to absolute deniers. Allah also forgives those who commit these or any other sins as a mistake, mistakes are considered as accidental, but punishes hard to deniers, those who know in their hearts with absolute clarity what is the truth and then deny it. 

My dear doesn’t know about you but throughout my life, I have seen my Muslim brothers committing the utter sin of shirk to the same degree Hindus or monks or Amazonians do. and I call them Muslim brothers and I eat their zabiha and I pray with them and fast with them and Hajj with them give charity but I do not get in a matrimonial relationship with them, that’s where I have a right and authority to do so. I cannot call them Mushrik or Kafar. I only preach them, teach them, do the reasoning with them and maximum I say they are ignorant, may Allah purify their knowledge, they know Shirk is haram but they are doing it and it’s an utter mistake. Allah will judge them on the day of judgement.

No scholar or group of righteous people or Supreme Court, country, khilafa, or Jins or even a neuro AI computer that could read people’s mind has a right or authority to declare them Mushrik or Kafar. Please put a stone on your heart and understand that.

Allah has simply not given this right or authority to anyone.

If you think he has please educate me, I’ll be with you.

Now the followers of Mirza Ahmed Qadiyani are doing clear Kufar, they have started a clear new ummah, they have declared him another prophet. We are all eye witness of that we know it’s wrong we know it is unforgivable sin if they are doing it after an absolute clarity that it’s unforgivable and if they are making a mistake like our brothers who commit, bidah, Kufar, and irtadad then only Allah knows their hearts. We cannot judge them, we can only save ourself and do the reasoning with others why or why not.

Secondly I asked you, has Allah or his messenger made our duty to do so? That we have to put labels on people and declare who is who? Anywhere in Quran or Sunnah? I am sure no. You shared the ayahs yourself, it’s opposite. Instead, Allah wants us to take charge of our own life and make our own life as pure as possible, purify our body as much as possible, purify our food, purify our morality and show our deepest obedience to Allah and have fear of our own wrongdoings, especially with others and have the patience for all the hardships be deeply grateful for our blessings. This life will end and we will be rewarded by the forgiveness of Allah and his blessings for eternity. We are not here to judge others or monitor what they are doing. Allah will most certainly judge us all soon.

May he forgive us because we keep our heads down and do not arrogantly become judge or authority on sins Allah has not give any right to us.
