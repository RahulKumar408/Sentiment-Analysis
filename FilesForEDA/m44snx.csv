gqtiy8w,t1_gqstfwl,"Pindi Cantt looks way better than Isb these days. Bahria is completely fake and artificial, like Dubai, so itâ€™s obviously going to look better. When comparing cities, the actual cities should be compared and not suburbs like Bahria (even if theyâ€™re as large as cities).

Anyways, Islamabadâ€™s architecture is its biggest weakness. It probably has the worst architecture of any major Pakistani city, due to the fact that it was built in the postmodern era, and all of it aged HORRIBLY. Islamabad couldâ€™ve been a world-class city in terms of beauty but the architecture brings it down by so many notches. Only the Margallas and the cleanliness of the sectors north of the I-sectors are Islamabadâ€™s saving grace.

If you ever take the service road for the expressway, you donâ€™t know whether youâ€™re in Islamabad or Lakki Marwat.",1,6,1615659093.0
gqt4rik,t1_gqstfwl,">Bahria Pindi

Really? I felt that people have started to leave their mark. It seems like a nice clean area of pakistan. Not something foreign.

BTK on the other hand still looks like a completely different country (since so little people live there now).",1,2,1615651645.0

gqtad4k,t1_gqt4rik,"Bahria Pindi is great, although I don't know how much of that currently owes to the fact that it has not been fully populated to capacity yet... But wide roads, nice planned parking lots etc and it looks very nice overall.",2,5,1615654613.0
gqysbr8,t1_gqyh3rh,"Half the G-sectors are a mess too. The disparity between the ""1 Kanal neighbourhoods"" and the ""10 marla neighbourhoods"" is ridiculous. G-9 is probably the worst sector in Islamabad overall.

Also, the sectors make up only Zone I of Islamabad. The vast majority of Islamabad is not the sectors, only about 30% is. Zone IV is basically a mini Karachi (and I'm not talking about the good parts"").",3,-1,1615770269.0
