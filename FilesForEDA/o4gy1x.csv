Try talking about this issue to an Uighur, there are many who are living in Pakistan, wo shayad apko bata dein kitna hi western propaganda hai aur kitna sach hai. I have a friend who has not been able to contact his extended family for 6 years now.

Regardless of all the photos, videos and testimonies that may very well be doctored, look up the Xinjiang papers. Funnily, China had very contradicting statements about them which gives you reason to suspect that there is something going on. The Foriegn Minister says that these govt reports were ""hyped up out of proportion"" and leaking them ""was an attempt to discredit China's deradicalization attempts"". Then the Xinjiang Governor claims that they are totally fabricated lol. Bro which one is it? ""made up"" ya ""blown out of proportion"".  
Also China's own stance of going from blatantly denying that anything is going on in Xinjiang to putting it under the pretext of counter-terrorism is ridiculous too. If there is any propaganda here I believe its Communist propaganda, like lmao if you're pressed to release a song about how peaceful Xinjiang is then its quite evident there's a skeleton in your closet. Like ye koi nayi baat nai hai ke China is hiding up stuff, they've done that previously in the Tiananmen Square massacre and even with COVID.

 As for services, It's basically the same except that Gaza is often denied those services, you have a naval blockade including the fact that Error 404 patrol boats harass palestinian fishing boats.

HDI is a little complicated. Since Error 404 occupies almost all of Palestine's land excluding Gaza, they have relatively good infrastructure and services BECAUSE Error 404 treats the area as if though they own it. Since UN does not recognize that as Error 404 land, they put that area's HDI into Palestine's which makes it seem as if though Palestine is high on HDI which in reality, it's probably lower than Pakistan's.

You really are joking, Pakistan's security is relatively better then that of Palestine, you don't have Paramilitary forces arresting children and locking them in cages like animals. As I mentioned, you don't have a fear that a war plane will just drop missiles on you
