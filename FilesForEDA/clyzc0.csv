ew33d74,t1_evyu1et,"Tough, tiring, but so worth it. It was probably the worst experience of my life while I was doing it, and the best now that it's finished. Nearly 20-30km walks every day, living on glaciers, no organized bathrooms, but man the end result was definitely worth it!",1,4,1565062941.0

ew33ru0,t1_evyzl7z,"I know! We stayed 2 nights and that was my fear too. When I arrived at Concordia, around 12/1pm, K2 had just gone into hiding behind the clouds and we had our eyes glued up until the evening when it cleared up juuuuust slightly. The first night it was clear initially but then it started pouring all till the morning. We went to the base camp, it was all cloudy and when we were coming back to Concordia from the base camp that same afternoon, it started to clear up. By the evening it was mostly clear, that's when I took this picture. It was all clear at night and mostly clear the next morning too, and when we left Concordia for Goro-I at around 9am, it started to become cloudy again. 

I'd suggest stay there for 3 nights at least and maximize your chances, but the best chances are probably gonna be in the evenings or early mornings",1,2,1565063291.0
