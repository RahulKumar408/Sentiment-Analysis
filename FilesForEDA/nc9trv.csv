gy7bufh,t3_nc9trv,"This, in all honesty, is heart breaking. They don’t deserve this life just cause they were unfortunate to be born in a poor family, they should have the exact same opportunities to learn, play and grow up as all the other children not born into poverty. The hard truth is that the regular citizens of Pakistan share a large part of the blame for these unfortunate children. How? Well, we employ small children to play with, entertain or watch after other children in the house, Or employ them to help with household chores. We even treat them with contempt when we see them selling or begging out on the streets. This video just goes to show you that at the end of the day they’re still children and long for the same things and treatment as all the other children. Gift them something they can play with or eat like chocolate and their faces will light up. I know idiots will now be thinking ‘bUt iF We dOnT emPloY tHem THeiR fAmiLy woNt eAt,wE aRe hElpInG tHeM’. well, if you care so much then how about you do your own damn work and pay these children to go attend school or to just go out and play instead of working for you. I really hope that one day all the children in Pakistan can have a normal childhood and have equal access to opportunities in life to be whatever they want to regardless of their socioeconomic condition.",0,1,1621076977.0
gy7c8wv,t3_nc9trv,There are many many children out here jn Islamabad.  Unfortunately most of them are part of an organised group of beggers. I try to feed them but they iften dont accept anything but cash. For some time now i just feed children and not give them money. It doesnt help their situation much but its the least i can do. It still leaves a lump of guilt in my gut but it is what it is. If there are organisations that can actually make a long term commitment to street kids please let me know.,0,1,1621077308.0

gy4b82h,t1_gy45brt,"Not shame shame. Honestly, the country is poor. What's being done in Palestine is on a state/country level. What I would suggest to you is to not have this shame shame attitude, as that doesn't really help. Rather, you should highlight the governance and political issues of the country, and focus your anger there.

Remember, what sets Palestine and Kashmir apart is the atrocities done on a Country level, which require collective condemnation. No one should advocate for war, unless they have to fight it themselves, so there I agree with you.

For street children and fighting the poverty visible on the streets, I just think setting up a federal and provincial welfare agency, combined with close working with Traffic and regular Police, would help. As one part of a bigger solution (lunch vouchers, health insurance etc.).",1,6,1621011398.0
