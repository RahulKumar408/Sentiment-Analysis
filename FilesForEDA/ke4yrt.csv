I remember our teacher telling all of us to gather in one corner of the class for safety reasons but hearing constant gun fire and mini blasts was horrific but not surprising since in those times you would hear about terrorist attacks every single day. Lost a close friend but his brother survived and probably many of my junior school friends that were currently in the grade that were affected the most from it. Many other incidents including bomb blast right outside my mom college (federal) where she taught, a bomb that was kept outside the gate of my sister's school (army public school girls branch) which was alhumdulliah defused right infront of our eyes, to begin Evacuated several times from our school to safe areas incase of a potential threat, to feeling shock waves and seeing bomb clouds almost every other day when coming back from school or going outside, and blasts happening at places which we would normally visit or times where if we were there a couple minutes/hours early or late, we would have been victims of those attacks. Those were scary times but APS attack really broke the seal and I highly doubt the terrorism would have stopped if that didn't happen 💔 I remember there weren't even enough ambulances that day and would see alot of them stop mid way at the side of the road for whatever horrific reason I don't want to know.",0,4,1608140341.0

It’s pretty obvious, You certainly lack any knowledge of facts. No Pakistan didn’t just focus on Easter border. There was an ongoing military offense on western front; zarb-e-azab ring any bell in your knucklehead? Probably not, since it might have been omitted in your talking point brainwashing briefing. It was precisely this offense and other past operation (Musharraf time) that Indian used to influenced local through Afghanistan to fund, infect and attack Pakistan in countless domestic terror attack.

I don't get what you're saying, or which country you're referring to. I'm an Indian lurker btw. The point is that, yesterday I saw the same picture on another sub asking for Indian blood as revenge for the murdered children in the Peshawas school attack, with the comments suggesting to ""carpet bomb"" the embassies and execute all the remaining diplomats, etc.

I was taken totally by surprise, cuz I had seen the news too then and was saddened by the barbaric attack by Taliban on a school. I still don't get how and why India would be called responsible for it. Yeah I get it that Pakistanis hate India as much as Indian hate Pakistan. Pakistan is sometimes unfairly called responsible for everything in India, and when you hate someone, he's called Pakistani agent. I agree that not all of the so called ""evidence against Pakistan"" shown are not genuine.

But I think it's insane to call India responsible for that. Not that India would never do such a thing, my holy country is always right, that kinda thing. But Pakistan has has always had a heavy presence of many terrorist entities in it's soil. Taliban had control of an entire region of Pakistan, Malala was shot at Pakistan, Osama Bin Laden was killed at Pakistan, and Ajmal Kasab an the other terrorists behind the Mumbai attack were legit Pakistanis. Sad that despite being called terrorists, more Pakistanis have suffered at the hands of these terrorists, and Pakistan has the right to call itself more the victim of terrorism as it has suffered the most. India has only had a few terror attacks when compared to that. 

I wouldn't brand an entire nation/race as terrorists. Especially when before 73 years, we shared the same name, especially a region that gave birth to many of our greatest freedom fighters, especially a place that has had more martyrs and widows of terror-victims. I think Pakistan did a mistake by getting involved in the Soviet-American affairs and recruiting it's own men to fight the soviets in Afghanistan, and it's the same that backfired as Taliban and is causing havoc. I'm just glad that India didn't have to get involved in this, as Pakistan actively became a buffer zone.",4,2,1608178222.0
