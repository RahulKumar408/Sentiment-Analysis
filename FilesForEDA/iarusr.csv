As for being a civil service town, it's slowly shifting away from that, alot of people are moving into the city and the ""older"" parts of the city are getting more and more expensive and now only really the rich can buy houses there so the city is slowly shifting towards being the place for the rich.

g1ra0yw,t1_g1qyk7z,"PPP and MQM seem to be a dynamic that has paralysed politics and governance in Karachi. I understand it's an important port for Pakistan but why do rich continue to live there and not love to Islamabad or Lahore? 

Also as an Indian Pakistani development seems to be a lot more arbitrary in nature than India. No offence but would you say development in India is a lot more democratic i.e. stakeholders are more often than not approached and talked to before building anything. DHA housing in Karachi will probably have no parallel in India. But all this just points out to a stronger civil society in India but then it's Pakistan that has had a Pinjra Tod kind of movement whereas India largely has been bereft of any such movements. 

I have been looking for a good PolEcon read of Pakistan as well. Not an academic reading of it but a smoother version if available. That kind of a book would certainly explain the rise of Islamabad and the structures such rise supports and engenders.",2,4,1597601979.0

Great question. Great question.  Why live in Pakistan if one is rich?  A lot of the rich just leave and move to Dubai or whereever.
