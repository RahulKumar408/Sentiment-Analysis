gm0r71u,t3_lclxka,"They have totally dehumanized Pakistanis (Muslims) to the point that their most watched TV channel got fined in the UK for airing [hate speech](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/dec/23/indian-news-channel-fined-in-uk-for-hate-speech-about-pakistan).

This was what the regulatory body‚Äôs report stated:

>	Republic TV was fined ¬£20,000 for airing a segment on its UK service, which conveyed the view that all Pakistani people are terrorists, including ‚Äútheir scientists, doctors, their leaders, politicians [‚Ä¶] Even their sports people‚Äù.

>	Ofcom said it had received multiple complaints from viewers for the ‚Äúhighly pejorative references to members of the Pakistani community (eg continually referring to them as ‚Äòfilthy‚Äô)‚Äù on Goswami‚Äôs show

>	 In the programme, the presenter and some of his guests conveyed the view that all Pakistani people are terrorists, including that: ‚Äútheir scientists, doctors, their leaders, politicians all are terrorists. Even their sports people‚Äù; ‚Äúevery child is a terrorist over there. Every child is a terrorist. You are dealing with a terrorist entity‚Äù. One guest also described Pakistani scientists as ‚Äúthieves‚Äù, while another described Pakistani people as ‚Äúbeggars‚Äù. In the context of these criticisms, the presenter, addressing Pakistan and/or Pakistani people, said: ‚ÄúWe make scientists, you make terrorists‚Äù.

>	A third guest, General Sinha said, ‚ÄúOh you useless people. Beggars. Oh beggars, oh beggars. We will douse you with 1.25kg, .75kg-, with two inches. PoK8, PoK, we are coming to the PoK. We are coming to the Gilgit, Baltistan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa...We are going to come, be ready. People in your country are shivering with fear that the Indian army may come. We will barge inside your home in Baluchistan, in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, in Karachi, in your area, in Multan, in Rawalpindi and kill you. From Lahore, from Karachi to Gilgit-Balistan when we will have control‚Äù 

>	Ofcom acknowledged that the programme included one Pakistani guest who expressed the view three times that the success of India‚Äôs space programme was ‚Äúa victory for humanity‚Äù and ‚Äúa matter of happiness‚Äù. The same guest welcomed any advances by India in technology, in education, in health and in protection of minorities and indicated that Pakistan wished to learn from Indian surgeons and cooperate in sectors such as education and technology. The programme presenter indicated that India‚Äôs advance in space technology was ‚Äúthe advancement of the whole world‚Äù. We took into account that the Pakistani guests made some strong criticisms of Indian policy and its leaders.

>	However, we considered the inclusion of limited ‚Äúconciliatory‚Äù statements and brief comments which were highly critical of India by Pakistani guests failed to provide sufficient context and challenge. We considered that the overall tone of the discussion was provocative, comparing Pakistanis to donkeys and monkeys. We also noted that Pakistani contributors were repeatedly interrupted and afforded little time to make points which may potentially have provided challenge or context.

Not to even mention the extensive fake news network and agitprop actors like Tarek Fateh and Husain Haqqani on their payroll. 

Unfortunately most other groups in South Asia, especially Sikhs, buy into this kind of villainous rhetoric about Pakistan wholeheartedly so there is no point in reaching out for any kind solidarity as we will be rejected anyways and associating with us just hurts their cause.
