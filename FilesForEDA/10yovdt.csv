You should see what went on in Karachi during Nawaz's time in 90's before Musharraf, People were being picked up house to house and killed in many areas (by army men).

The second time the crackdowns happened was during downfall of MQM, they were pretty bad too though not as bad as the first time. It was during this time the rangers were there to mainly conduct operations and crackdowns especially in areas like Nine-Zero.

The only problem the second time was that Taliban were also having fun in Karachi as well so people kind of had to still rely on one side.

j834i0f,t1_j82w0bu,"(Note: I am not defending MQM crimes or anything here)

The answer may vary depending on who you ask, according to what I have heard from our elders is that there was a tension between Mahajirs and others. This started to go in a worse direction since Bhutto's Quota system.

After MQM was formed it ""advocated"" for rights of Mahajirs, it gained a large support over the years. This made the then ruling parties (PMLN, PPP) feel ""threatened"", as MQM was gaining momentum across many places.

So operations were started against MQM and to an extent against Mahajirs to quell down the ""threat"" to both dynastical families (that were already at each other's throats). Hyderabad and Karachi suffered the most in these operations.

As a result more people rallied behind MQM against PPP and PMLN and the hatred still remains in many to this day. But this is just my perspective. There may be other sides as well. 

As for the second phase it was under Nawaz's term (again) to quell MQM in Karachi and well... he succeeded but het got kicked out of power thankfully soon after but the city was still under surveillance by rangers and armed forces (because TTP), which went up until 2017.

It was more than sectarian, to simplify it big men in power did not wanted to lose their hold so they took all measures to quell the opposition (like they are trying with PTI right now)",7,2,1676100328.0
