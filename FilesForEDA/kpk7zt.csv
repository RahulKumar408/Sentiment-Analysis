(edit: this became way longer than I thought bc I just kinda unloaded everything here. I'd appreciate if anyone read and has something to say bc I want as much feedback as possible <3)

or at least I used to be I guess. I lived a pretty comfortable life in Pakistan and I was basically a weaboo for America, since a lot of my family lives there and I was obsessed with pop culture and all that superficial shit. I've just now found out what a burger is and almost everything checks the boxes for me. I moved to America a couple years ago and over the years I've come to realize what a fucking idiot I used to be. I used to always try to speak American English and thought I was cool for doing so. I speak English fluently now in an almost perfect American accent, and being in America that's a huge advantage, but now my Urdu is broken af. tbf that's not completely my fault, as I haven't taken an Urdu course since I was in fourth grade, and I couldn't write a paragraph with prefect spelling if I had to. Moving to America and seeing the polarization in religion, economic inequality, culture, and politics in general has made me hyperaware of what I used to be. I look back at my old self with disgust, as its everything I resent. I try to speak Urdu all the time, never in the house or with my family. I'm going to try to read more Urdu literature, as I've been working on reading Urdu for a while and I can definitely say ive improved my reading. Although it is difficult for me to complete a long conversation in Urdu without saying at least a couple words in English. I guess coming to America has been both a blessing and a curse, as I'm now a much better person and am aware of my privilege, even if I don't live as comfortably as I did in Pakistan, but now I've become severely detached from my cousins in Pakistan, who grew up in their own environment, not having any connections to America, and there's a strong cultural divide I feel whenever I talk to them. I guess that was the biggest thing that made me realize my idiocy. If I had continued to live in Pakistan I might have still been close to my cousins and family but I would still just have been a burger asshole, but now that I'm here and have somewhat experienced a relatively upper-middle class lifestyle that's not as comfortable in some ways as in Pakistan, and seen what America really is outside of the superficial pop-culture consumerist bullshit, I've now just become very detached from whom I consider the closest people to me. I know OP's post was kind of just a shitpost meme, but I have family that pretty much lives in a house identical to that in Lahore, and seeing stuff like that reminds me of the severe alienation I feel from my literal home country.",0,11,1609696339.0

ghzteas,t1_ghypyk5,"it's just a term to 'other' people and it's very inconsistent. burger is a catch all term for 'westernized'/'liberal', and that keeps shifting. It originally was making fun of people who called 'bun kababs', 'burgers'. Even though bun kabab places name themselves burger places often enough for it to be interchangeable. Now it ranges from anyone who speaks English better than Urdu, even if their Urdu is perfectly fine, to gatekeeping real Pakistani-ness, to dismiss a demographic as not representative because projecting class anxiety/punching up/pushing at outsiders is okay. 

Growing up at the edge of a kachi abaadi i saw it used mostly on Christians who spoke English well to exclude them, or the old money kids who still spoke english well enough but lived in a tiny two bedroom apartment and were struggling, or visiting 2nd generation Pakistanis, most of whom spoke Urdu better than locals because their parents made a concerted effort to teach them their culture. 10 to 20 years ago it was someone who wore pants and shirts to Friday prayers, or the boys who didn't swear as much and play grab ass or run around on motorbikes without a license since they were underage. Those guys didn't get as much attention from the girls because peppering every conversation with MC / BC not using deodorant puts people off, and it was hard to take a chance dating someone who was running wild back when dating could still be a massive taboo.

For me it was when I started reading more english books at the corner dhaaba/park, because they were easier to get in the topics I liked outside of pulp fiction/magazines. Other kids felt excluded, so they gradually stopped talking to me except to make fun of spending my time reading, and the kapra my mom told me to use to lie down on the grass because she didn't want me to get grass stains and mud on my clothes so we wouldn't waste water. I met some of them years later, speaking fluent English mostly, and no problems with me otherwise.

I’m also not a fan of religion in government and find that a lot of cultural practices like treatment of those with mental health issues needs to go. 

The point though is that I still see the good side. A lot of Pakistanis are protesting the corruption in government, a lot of Pakistanis are demanding better rights, a lot of Pakistanis are willing to stand up for minorities like Christians and Hindus and Aurat March was cool because it showed that there are even those seeing that conditions for women need to to improve. I still appreciate the history that stretches all the way back to the Indus River Valley, I still understand a lot of Pakistan’s issues come from colonialism, and I still wanna see the nation get better.

The only thing is, it seems that you wish for Pakistan to become secular and then also adopt other liberal ideas (I'm assuming things like same sex marriage, etc). The issue with this is that it goes outside the political overton window of Pakistan, to the point where any leader who attempts to secularize Pakistan would be seen as a traitor, be overthrown, and be executed. How Pakistanis see secularists isn't that different from how Americans see Muslims that want sharia enforced in the US. So what you want Pakistan to ""improve"" towards is something almost no one wants.
