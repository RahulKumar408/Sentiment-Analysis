First, the establishment isn't the military, it's a bunch of high ranking officials in the judiciary, government institutions, intelligence, military and even civilians.

Since Pakistan has always (justifiably) been paranoid National security state, rooted from existential threats, it was no surprise that the military had to keep on its toes and that the establishment heavily favors them.

The other government institutions refused to shape up which is why military is forced to step in every time.

In fact, we should all be thankful for Musharraf's coup forcing Nawaz Sharif out of government, he had been looking to do to the military what he had done to the judiciary, law enforcement, and bureaucracy of Pakistan, politicize it and fill it with people loyal to him.

Before this he had dismissed a very popular COAS and replaced him with Musharraf who wasn't exactly the most senior military officer, then he had actually replaced Musharraf as the COAS with a cousin who he had assigned as DG ISI before both of them were arrested.

Bhutto had done this very same thing with Zia, to have a weak puppet COAS but got hanged instead. Nawaz should have been hanged too. 

He played with the lives of all the people on that flight just to screw Musharraf over. 

If either had ever been successful then the army would have actually been filled with incompetent people only there because of connections or loyalty to politicians.

Maybe, but this shouldn't have escalated to deaths. They should have done their work and predicted the influx of tourists. And they should have made arrangements in Murree regarding such weather conditions, maybe keep the armed forces on alert if they didn't have policemen or labour to clear the roads. And at the very least they should have clearly warned people by sending out a PSA about such weather conditions (although I don't think it was that severe personally, it was made severe due to negligence).

Let out all the hate bro, and then breathe. All your awesome angst from Canada is super helpful. Solid educated advice on  closing down a whole city for several years and jailing thousands of people.

Love how here you are all down on shutting down a city, and jailing thousands of people without due process for moral crimes....and in another comment, you're hating on all the people coming into Murree and referring to them all as morons. So which is it? Also why do you hate Desi's so much? In Pakistan and in Canada apparently. 

""fucking hell, THANKYOU. this is what im saying/ the government/news warned about heavy snowfall. these morons still went. unprepared.into snow. without snow tires or chains or a plan of retreat. 

iv lived in canada, a lot of desis get caught in the storms because ""daikha jaiga"", this is the exact same mentality.""

We wait for our military to come and rescue us? And if you are saying that the government is a weak institution then that is simply not true, I personally knew sons/daughters of ex-MPAs and current MNAs and they were extremely corrupt. They had bungalows in Murree (same place where they cannot make arrangements for a couple 100 cars and few inches of snow), a showroom worth of cars, mansions abroad and were literally untouchable while being extremely proud of that. The government of this country treats you like shit, you can keep directing all the blame at your military but don't understand the core problem which is the feudal, corrupt system sponsored by the state and a joke of a democracy this country has. We need complete reforms.

And now they want the government and military to come bail them out? and then blame the government for incompetence? REALLY?

yes it is solid advice, if you really think about it, no one wants to think about it because it seems draconian, but honestly its the last thing left to do. The ""city"" is jam packed 7 days a week, the roads cant sustain the traffic. They overcharge for everything and act like badmash. Things need to be reset to quite an extent. And this is the perfect chance to do it. 

and yes, what i have against ""desis"" or rather desi mentality is exactly this, they point and laugh in the face of any illness wear no masks, congregate every chance they get, then get sick, bitch and moan like no ones business and then complain its the governments fault. same with dengue, same with corona. i personally know people who think the vaccine is adding magnetic things to their arm and now things stick to their arms. And now they are refusing the vaccine because its free, but these same morons were complaining that the vaccine wasnt available and should be free like a year ago. 

They are then pointing and laughing in the face of danger, then bitching and moaning when things go sideways. just like right now. same concept. its a fucking tragedy. what did the kids have to do with their parents stupid choices? the kids didnt know jackshit. and therefore any surviving parent should definitely be charged, jailed and their driving licenses stripped away. They not only put their own family in danger and killed them, but they aided in jam packing a hard to reach area and made it an issue for everyone else and basically aided in the deaths and trauma of others. 

I literally read a report on December 20th telling us to expect heavy snowfall and be careful on dawn.com, but does anyone GIVE A SHIT? nope.

i have no angst from Canada in this regard. everyone knows you need to look out for the weather before traveling. if you get stuck in your own transport or public transport, not everyone is so understanding. You should think before you venture out whether you are putting your life at risk or not, and its usually the people with desi mindsets who think that a bit of snow, ice and rain cant hurt them...in their 2wd corollas without snow tires (because kon kharcha karay), and then cause traffic jams, accidents and have rescue operations conducted, and then they are fucking charged for it, if its deemed that they could have easily avoided all this.
