 This is not something that can really be proved via stats and numbers as its based on perceived performance.

"First of all, regardless of his sins, I don't believe it gave anyone the right to end his life. 
 
 Secondly, if you think this is all about glorifying him as a person, then we clearly see things differently. I see this more about what his death represented. It represented a system that oppresses and abuses people based on their race. A system where the punishment for a crime is a warning if you're white, but a death sentence if you're black. Painting his face on mural is bringing attention to that in a way that is not as easily avoidable because it's in people's faces.",0,0,0,0

 It's a suggestion. A view on how things can be handled for the better. I don't quite recall a world leader who encourages people to go abroad and blow themselves up in places. When that day comes, maybe IK will write to them too. But his stance and message right now is evidently correct.",1,0,1,1

"PPP and MQM seem to be a dynamic that has paralysed politics and governance in Karachi. I understand it's an important port for Pakistan but why do rich continue to live there and not love to Islamabad or Lahore? 
 
 Also as an Indian Pakistani development seems to be a lot more arbitrary in nature than India. No offence but would you say development in India is a lot more democratic i.e. stakeholders are more often than not approached and talked to before building anything. DHA housing in Karachi will probably have no parallel in India. But all this just points out to a stronger civil society in India but then it's Pakistan that has had a Pinjra Tod kind of movement whereas India largely has been bereft of any such movements. 
 
 I have been looking for a good PolEcon read of Pakistan as well. Not an academic reading of it but a smoother version if available. That kind of a book would certainly explain the rise of Islamabad and the structures such rise supports and engenders.",-1,0,0,0

 I agree that Muhajirs from Karachi may have ties to India, however it is not the case with the rest of the 90% of Pakistanis.
 
 For example a large portion of our population have lineages from Arabia, Persia, and Turkic regions.
 
 Persian was the language which previously was spoken to communicate between our regions. If you ask elders, most of them were fluent in Persian.
