g2sfq3p,t1_g2sf7of,Thanks!! That's awesome. It was such a tough video to make because I have no prior or any knowledge for that matter concerning aviation. Had to set everything on easy and hope for the best. But man I'm just floored by it. it's amazing what they have achieved on a technical level. If one has the system and can get through the download they should definitely try it out. Magic.,1,18,1598354964.0
g2sh2mo,t1_g2sflnx,"Yeah sure. I'm not very PC savvy. I primarily game on my Xbox but I'll try answering the best I can. My PC has an RTX 2060 and a 3700x and I'm playing at 1440p all settings set to high with TAA (saw on a digital foundry video that ultra doesn't do much other than melt stuff). Vsync is off, capped the fps to 30 or atleast tried to in the settings; read that the game runs uncapped regardless which they might fix with an update so I'm not sure about this. Everything worked fine and looked great. There were menial hiccups here and there after extended playtime (2-3 hours in) but otherwise and even then it worked swell. Loading times aren't ideal, they're not bad perse but they're not amazing either. On the subject of the internet. Firstly the game download is 130 GB, took me days to download. As you probably know the game fetches satellite data on the fly I was working with a 20mb consistent connection (not Ptcl lol) absolutely no issues at all with that but yes I could tell that I was above the bare minimum with the internet speed. Don't think one could run this on a 8/10mb inconsistent connection without issues. Hope this helped.",1,27,1598356105.0
g2shpsh,t1_g2shdo8,"I actually switched out the mouse for the controller. The keyboard you still have to use in tandem as the game has way too many inputs. I just personally feel more comfortable using the analogs, its easier to record sweeping cinematic shots on a controller. But I think the game is definitely intended for mouse and keyboard.",1,5,1598356620.0

g2skmyf,t1_g2sk38p,"The only impressive 3D model I found was Faisal Mosque. Saw no full scale buildings in blue area :(. Badshahi mosque etc it's all there, it's accurate location/texture wise just sometimes not in it's full glory. Not as fleshed out as gmaps because it uses bing's cloud data. But if you fly around well documented cities internationally it's very very impressive. So it depends on where you go.",1,10,1598358808.0

g2tljod,t1_g2sizzq,"I havent played it yet but that's what I've heard. Not only that but they use live weather information for their weather engine in game.

Also there are other AI planes that will travel according to the flight tracking of actual planes.",1,3,1598376518.0

g2suab4,t1_g2stwla,Not really. The minimum requirement is actually 5mb. Recommended is 20 which I have. Problem for us in Pakistan is the quality of connection. Packet loss etc. It just needs to be consistent.,1,4,1598364673.0
