The very idea of watching a bunch of grown men swatting little balls in the sun for hours is just... idiotic and seeing people cheering and rooting for their respective teams boggles my mind. 

Why? What drives them? Exactly what they find so satisfying that they gladly spend hours upon hours watching a ball get swatted around with a piece of wood?

Entertainment is entirely subjective, no doubt. What's 'entertainment' for sadists is 'punishment' for... pretty much everyone else, really!

The only people who speak urdu natively are muhajirs from karachi. The VAST majority of Pakistanis speak local languages like punjabi, seraiki, pashto, etc. Although there usually is a comparably small population of local urban elite who prefer to speak urdu.

I was watching a candid interview of Tigmanshu Dhulia, he grew up in Allahabad in a educated Hindu family.. his pronunciation was standard Urdu pronunciation, and he would easily pass off as an Urdu speaker without doubt.
