>Their mainstream TV shows regularly mock religion and God.

An atheist Pakistani who moves to the U.S. will eventually realize that mainstream America is secular on the surface only.

What really happens in the U.S. is the e.g. [72 million Catholic Americans](https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&sxsrf=ALeKk01urZOTbFACXlNpaNyOBIER-LViqA%3A1585564792330&ei=eMyBXo3cE8e4tAafq4_ICA&q=catholics+in+us+&oq=catholics+in+us+&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzoECAAQRzoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoHCAAQFBCHAjoHCAAQgwEQQzoCCAA6BQgAEIMBOgQIABAKUJH3NljoiDdgjYo3aABwBXgAgAFoiAGZCJIBBDE1LjGYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwiN-NuRgcLoAhVHHM0KHZ_VA4kQ4dUDCAs&uact=5) send their kids to [1000+ private Catholic schools](https://www.university-list.net/us/rank/school-300036.html), universities and churches littered across the U.S. that, of course, don't teach secular topics like evolution and homosexuality.

America puts out probably the most sexual/violent content in the world but don't forget America also invented a moral censorship system with a secular disguise which are the ratings PG, PG-13, R, etc. as a national law which comes from a White Christian American morality.

Speaking of the Bible, [every hotel room in America has a copy of the Bible](https://www.mic.com/articles/182597/why-do-hotels-still-put-a-bible-in-the-nightstand) in the bedside drawer.  I think I heard one hotel also having the Quran because the owner was Muslim but don't quote me on that. This is not a law, people just do that.

**Morality is subjective.** If you judge the West with a Pakistani Muslim narrative of morality, you will of course view America as this infidel nation of gays who gamble, get high and fuck on the streets all day or wtv is your definition of immorality...the reality is America took 15 years to finally legalize gay marriage after the first country did. Marijuana is *still* a crime at the national level. That's all I'm saying: people may think America is more immoral than Europe but it's not.

These ""immoral"" legalizations were passed on democratically because of course high taxes are levied.

And of course Catholics aren't a majority @ 72 mil. Christians are. 70% of Americans identify as such to varying degrees and it *is* a big deal by western standards. I'll throw in another stricter group to further illustrate my point of how conservative/religious America is: the [15 million Mormons out of Utah](https://www.pbs.org/mormons/faqs/), a purely American version of Christianity that ""abstain from coffee and tea, alcohol, tobacco and illegal drugs."" Also have a strict female dress code and no body piercing rules. Wow so moral! By the way, if you think they don't matter, Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican Presidential nominee, is a practicing Mormon and that was a big talking point in his candidacy. Obama narrowly beat him in the popular vote by just 4%.

The U.S. is also where the Amish Christians come from. Why do I mention this group? This is a home-grown American invention of Christianity that makes even Mormons go ""WTF?"". They don't believe in using electricity, gas or any modern convenience and they dress *exactly* how their ancestors do. Doubt they will become atheistic anytime soon. They are only 250,000 people but pure numbers aren't even the point I'm making with the Amish...they still ride horses to work because of religious beliefs!! Where in Europe can you find this kind of belief system in 2020?

Personally, I'm an Atheist. I've lived in America for 10 years. I enjoy reading up on American politics and history (spoilers: there's not a lot to celebrate).
