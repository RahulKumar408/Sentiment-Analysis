No, I am not saying Tianemen Square was ok.  We all know that the millions who died in Partition it was not justified.  Tianemen was also a type of Partition.  The 80's in China was a revolution.  

I highly recommend checking out Reddits favorite documentary guy Adam Curtis. He has some new series which shows the interviews of the leaders and followers of Tianemen and offers some real insights.

These are very complicated events.  If you or I were in charge or part of the protest I do not know what we would do different without hindsight.
