ht5frlx,t3_s6rbl0,Was tough to watch but this is a reminder how these athletes and even everyday people are treated and which is exactly why we as a nation will never succeed. Greed and Corruption.

Greed does not value talent.

 Sadly, this is why people leave Pakistan because there is nothing for them to do. So many barriers have been erected to get basic rights. Almost every athlete have to face this issue. From Olympics to Boxing to Football, the stories are the same. No support, no funding, no professional guidance all while the top man takes every funding and lives a like a king. 

If I compare this to other instances, it's not just with sports. I remember when I was in school, the principal office had an AC. Library had AC but was never turned on when students used to go there. There was AC in Staff Room and cushioned seats. The staff room also had a mini UPS. Principal office and admin offices had a generator. On the other hand,  In a class full of 55 kids , all we got was ceiling fans that didn't work because there was no electricity for more than half of the day.",0,4,1642517432.0

Imran khan understands this & is trying his best to bring it down but it’s rooted so deep that it will take a monumental effort over many many decades to bring it down to a level of a mid order western country.
