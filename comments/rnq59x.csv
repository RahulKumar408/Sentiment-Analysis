Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Looking at another link, 
https://www.statista.com/statistics/476456/mass-shootings-in-the-us-by-shooter-s-race/

shows 66 whites, 20 blacks, 10 Latino, 8 Asians as perps of mass shootings over the past 40 years. That is pretty consistent with racial populations (though small sample size and 17 being classified as unknown/not clear). Black and Asian being overrepresented.

I'm white/Asian mix and live in a city that has witnessed a few mass shootings done by whites guys, while black killings were mostly relegated to the inner city, and that seemed to be true of other cities I've visited.",7,1,1640535369.0

Edit: since taco edited their comment I will do the same.

Neither you, nor anyone else is entitled to use degrading slurs towards anyone, especially not minorities that already face discrimination, which disabled people sadly usually are a part of.

You like our culture but would not visit because like you do not feel safe, i would be sweating pinballs if i ever started school there or like had to go to the USA in general so it's the same thing but i'd do that while i feel unsafe the entire time that's human-nature 101, though our part of the population who do immigrate there do that because of the money and jobs not because it's their dream or they're attracted to diversity, as they aren't able to find good jobs here as it's pretty competitive since everyone's in the IT sector these days, plenty of jobs in the USA, hard to find high paying ones in Pakistan and money's all that matters.",7,1,1640534527.0
