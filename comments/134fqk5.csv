Title: 9 Types of Pakistanis on Social Media - Which One Are You?

1.	The ""Mashallah"" Auntie: Always commenting ""Mashallah"" on every post, even if it's not relevant. They're known for their endless blessings and love for cute babies.

3.	The ""Desi Ghee"" Chef: Always sharing mouthwatering pictures of their homemade desi ghee delicacies. Their secret ingredient is always desi ghee.
4.	The ""Haw Haye"" Drama Fanatic: Always posting about the latest Pakistani dramas and swooning over the romantic scenes. Their heart skips a beat at the sight of Fawad Khan.
5.	The ""Biryani is Life"" Foodie: Always on the hunt for the perfect biryani. They judge restaurants based on the quality of their biryani and will travel far and wide to find the best one.
6.	The ""Mujhe Kyun Nikala"" Politician: Always blaming their political opponents for their problems. They're quick to play the victim and will use any opportunity to criticize the government.
7.	The ""Lambi Choti"" Hair Expert: Always sharing tips and tricks for long, luscious hair. They swear by their homemade remedies and will try anything to get Rapunzel-like locks.
8.	The ""Haye Allah"" Romantic: Always posting about their significant other and how much they love them. Their social media is filled with love letters and romantic gestures.
9.	The ""Influencer"" Wannabe: Always posing for the camera and using hashtags like #OOTD and #InstaGood. They're trying to become the next big thing on social media and will do whatever it takes to gain followers.",0,32,1682950206.0

jizoxgb,t1_jizlq1o,"Coz they (liberals in this case but other groups like islamists too are hypocrites.

Our liberal people have been fuxxed up for a long time. They have been hypocritical.

First it was just KGB propaganda being funneled through PPP that created a whole generation of desi ""liberals"" and ""socialists"". These  old boomers would talk about Roti Kapra Makaan while supporting feudalism and trying to impose  authoritarianism themselves by having those socialism wet dreams.

Now we have liberals who denigrate every aspect of Pakistan whether it is bad or not. They'll blame EVERY problem on religion. Poverty, corruption, lack of education, health facilities, mortality rate, slow economic growth whatever. To these idiots everything's due to religion.

I recently had had some neo-liberal mfs telling me about how Mustafa Kamal was such a great liberal. I told them that he was  an authoritarian leader who never got elected and ruled as a dictator with a military background, killed thousands of innocent Kurds, bombed their villages, forced minorities to Turkify themselves and banned azaan, quran and traditional Turkic clothing like Fez. I pointed out that all these are contrary to liberal ideas of democracy, free will and tolerance but these idiots were happy that he was an enemy of religion and that was enough for them to worship him.

Same with many prominent neo-liberals like Syed Muzammil and others. They'll generalize the whole mass of Pakistani men as rapists and such. Isn't that a logical fallacy?? They talk all day about philosophy, the art of arguments and logical fallacies but will do the same mistakes.

I am not saying that the same hypocrisies cannot be seen among religious people. I for one do not associate with any Pakistani religious faction or group. But we Pakistanis have a habit of betraying our principles a lot. Whether its the politician, military, liberals, conservatives, feminists whatever. That's why these groups call each other pseudo \[insert\]",3,2,1683309529.0

I think the OP mentioned Gujjar because of their so-called prerogative in old times and most gujjar and jutts have this mentality that they are superior, my cousins from gaon carry that same mentality. 

Most people Living in villages are jutts and gujjars that's why they used that term

jih1rs4,t1_jif6u31,"I don't wanna get super into the OSP lore, but here's my breakdown:

America's melting-pot structure reduces the radicalness of most Muslims who end up there. Canada is more of a salad bowl where different demographics get to preserve bits of their heritage, but also co-interact with other cultures peacefully, so Canadian Pakis are still pretty chill for the most part.

The UK is f\*\*\*ed because that place straight-up let every village Paki in 1970s and 1980s in, and they ended up building enclaves where people cling to (and push) religion as a distinct part of their identity. I don't agree with the incredibly racist/myopic viewpoints that British groups like EDL bring up, but some of their concerns about the problematic practices British Paki families engage in are absolutely valid and deserve proper attention.",4,4,1682971143.0
jiqh1gc,t1_jip511r,"Starting off with the wannabe ‚ÄúArab‚Äù. Dresses and acts like one with his broken accent and probably drives what every other blue collar expat or average expat drives in the Gulf. Is often called out by people but his ego issues are sky high. 

Next is the Pakistani, who probably hasn‚Äôt visited Pakistan in over 10 or 15 years due to God knows what reason. (my dads case). 

Followed by people who have third or fourth generation of their family well settled in the Gulf. These are likely educated folks or have a business of some sort. Another thing is if they‚Äôre well educated, chances are these people are probably fluent with Arabic and in some cases hard to differentiate whether they‚Äôre a citizen (depends on the respective country) or an expat. 

And as always there‚Äôs PML(N) supporters. Speaking from experience, PML(N) supporters are living and doing well for themselves in Kuwait. Pretty stable job and good payment. Some have their families living with them too while most live alone. Of course they‚Äôre called ‚Äúpatwaris‚Äù too.

And of course you‚Äôll find people who behave like they‚Äôre from their village and live life as if their father has a strong feudal system like in Pakistan. These are the worst breeds of Pakistanis here in the Gulf. 

And the list goes on. Can‚Äôt remember of any other specific stereotypes but dramatic ‚ÄúPHAPPA KHUTTAN‚Äù aunties exist here as well. Many Pakistanis are toxic and often look for opportunities to rip somebody off or scam them (Yeah I‚Äôm looking at you, Young gen Pakistanis)",4,2,1683141313.0
