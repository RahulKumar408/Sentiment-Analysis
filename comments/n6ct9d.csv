2-3 years?

My father spent several years at different times in nothing but a tent along the border. (Throughout career) 

He spent almost 2 years in Siachen. (as a Captain) 

2 years in Swat. (as a Lt. Col) 

A year in Congo with the U.N

A year in Sudan. 

Some time in overlooking the fencing in Balochistan. 

And even the ""Luxuries"" were pretty crappy. The only things that could count as ""Luxury"" was maybe the Officers' Mess. Which was nothing more than a restaurant as you paid full price for everything. 

The houses were 95% of the times built from the British era and were somewhat renovated that someone could live in them. Some officers were lucky enough to get newer houses if they were constructed in some cantt (maybe a few). 

My father bought a Vitz in 2009 and he still drives it. 
Before that he had a Mehran.

Yeah. We definitely still have Captain HK, and maybe Mard-e-mom I think.

Also really miss Empress of Mars, she was pretty active on positive news coverage of Pakistan.

Here's the relevant part:

An Indian parliamentarian Ram Kumar Anand had also picked up the topic and revealed that the Indian army had failed to recapture the following Points:

Point 5353, Point Aftab 1, Point Saddle Bridge, Point Bunker Ridge, Shangruti, and Dhaulanag.

[Source: BBC article](http://archive.vn/n90F0).

>*On Wednesday, an Indian MP alleged that Pakistani troops were occupying six peaks on the Indian side of the LoC.The MP's claim followed a report in an Indian newspaper that a strategic peak, Point 5353, was under Pakistani occupation.The Indian army has refused to comment on the claim.*

It goes into more detail:

>India was locked in a ten-week long conflict with Pakistan last year, which began with a large-scale infiltration by Pakistan-backed forces on the Indian side of Kashmir.Following intense shelling and use of airpower, India claimed that it had cleared the intruders from all its territory.But Indian parliamentarian Ram Kumar Anand says six prominent peaks - Point 5353, Point Aftab 1, Point Saddle Bridge, Point Bunker Ridge, Shangruti and Dhaulanag - are still under Pakistani control.

So, India took back 2 of the 8 peaks, those being Tiger Hill and Tololing however lost more men and airforce assets and basicallt basically achieved nothing.",3,1,1620593624.0
