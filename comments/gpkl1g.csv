I called my mom this morning and she was getting frustrated on how people here were making stories about Covid 19 being fake and doctors killing supposed patients through injections instead.",3,7,1590341139.0
frpl4zg,t1_fro26ur,"Well to start off politicians have stated on air that these deaths are fake (just like trump and his cronies) and it has given credence to conspiracy theories.

The *vast* majority no longer thinks the death toll is as high as it is. (Understand that when i say vast I really do mean it. I have yet to meet someone who doesn’t believe that death toll is as high as they say it is)

Now from here they have multiple theories.

The strain of virus in Pakistan isn’t as lethal. (The most rational of the theories i have heard by far but then again it is based on incomplete data Pakistan has collected so far and not an actual study of the strains it self)

Another is that the PM is faking the numbers to get aid.

One that fits into all of these theories is that once a person dies of non corona related reasons doctors label it as a corona death. The anecdotal stories attached to this are almost always that the patient had cancer.

Another is that since Europeans and later the Americans have committed genocides for a long time and so they are capable of the most atrocious acts therefore the Doctors are giving lethal injections to patients and killing them and so are pakistani doctors because they are corrupt and vile. (This theory fits into the one below)

The last and the one that takes the cake is that there is *No* virus. Its fake yahoodi sazish to bring about the new world order and all the governments of the world are in on it for their benefits and the bill gates chip thing fits into this theory somehow I don’t remember.

I don’t get how these morons can say that the deaths are higher than they actually are even though our death/infected are 4% lower than US. Fucking US, the country that has the infrastructure and the ventilators and shit to save people and some how they believe it should be lower for us.

The real reason for the lower percentage is actually because people are running away/bribing people to get the bodies released so that they can give janaza to their loved ones themselves.",3,3,1590358312.0

Masks stops the spread of the the virus to others from your coughs and sneezes and protects your from directly ingesting water molecules with the virus from other people's coughs and sneezes.
