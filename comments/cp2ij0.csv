Their governments still allow immigration despite nativist movements, the same as how Islamic countries like the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia and Indonesia allow Hindu migration. And how does this relate to the Indian occupation of Kashmir? 

>It's just that the population there doesn't resort to terrorism.

So I guess white supremacist terror and Western/Russian/Israeli/Indian atrocities in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Palestine, Kashmir, Bosnia, Syria and Myanmar (all of which far outweigh the death toll of Islamic terrorism) don't exist? 

>Also, most of the immigrants there are ""refugees"" from Islamic countries. Have you considered that?

The majority of immigrants in the West aren't Islamic refugees you dunce, they're economic migrants just like Indians are. For example in the USA, only 3 million refugees have entered since 1980 (out of 40 million total immigrants since 1980) and out of those only 13% are Muslim.",3,3,1565629120.0
