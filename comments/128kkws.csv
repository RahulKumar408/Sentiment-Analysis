Just because it says that women will form the majority of the people of hell doesn't mean that the majority of women will be in hell. There have always been more women than men on earth so that's pretty much given.

>""Men are in charge of women by \[right of\] what Allah has given one over the other and what they spend \[for maintenance\] from their wealth. So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in \[the husband's\] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those \[wives\] from whom you fear arrogance - \[first\] advise them; \[then if they persist\], forsake them in bed; and \[finally\], strike them. But if they obey you \[once more\], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand."" Quran 4:34

Okay, so pious men are allowed to discipline their wives when their being unreasonable, what is your point?

>“The False Messiah will come upon this marsh of Marriqanat. Most of those who go out to him will be women, until a man goes back to his wife, his mother, his daughter, his sister, and his aunt to shackle them tightly, fearing they would go out to him.” Musnad Aḥmad 5353

Some of the hadith in Musnad Ahmed are inauthentic so I'm not 100% sure about this one.

>""The worst of your women unveil their beauty, take pride in their appearance, and they are hypocrites. None of them will enter Paradise except as rarely as you see a red-beaked crow.” Source: al-Sunan al-Kubrá 12480

jeksarp,t1_jek3zb4,">Majority of women will be in hell because they have periods due to which they can't pray. Periods are given by God. He himself has set the rule of not praying during periods. And he himself is calling them less religious, and sending them to hell for that. This is highly illogical.

He's calling them less religious? Where do you have evidence to back this up? Men and women both will be judged based on the hardships that they have to face and Allah (SWT) is so forgiving that you can't even comprehend his forgiveness. 

In Sahih al-Bukhari 3321 ""Allah's Messenger (ﷺ) said, ""A prostitute was forgiven by Allah, because, passing by a panting dog near a well and seeing that the dog was about to die of thirst, she took off her shoe, and tying it with her head-cover she drew out some water for it. So, Allah forgave her because of that.""

Just imagine this, Zina one of the biggest sins being forgiven just for this small action. 

Furthermore, if you want to know more about the status of women look at this hadith. 

In Sunan an-Nasa'i 3104 ""O Messenger of Allah! I want to go out and fight (in Jihad) and I have come to ask your advice."" He said: ""Do you have a mother?"" He said: ""Yes."" He said: ""Then stay with her, for Paradise is beneath her feet.""

This teaches Muslims to value and cherish their mothers and show them much love and respect.

&#x200B;

>Where are the phrases ""pious men"" and ""unreasonable women"" in the verse? Arrogance is a broad term and anything can he interpreted as such. In fact, men are allowed to beat their wives even if they ""fear"" arrogance from them. Women do not even have to act arrogantly, and they might get beaten.

I'm not sure where he got the translation of Qur'an 4:34 from but in this translation from Dr. Mustafa Khattab 

Qur'an 4:34 ""Men are the caretakers of women, as men have been provisioned by Allah over women and tasked with supporting them financially. And righteous women are devoutly obedient and, when alone, protective of what Allah has entrusted them with. And if you sense ill-conduct from your women, advise them ˹first˺, ˹if they persist,˺ do not share their beds, ˹but if they still persist,˺ then discipline them ˹gently˺. But if they change their ways, do not be unjust to them. Surely Allah is Most High, All-Great."" 

It says if you sense ""ill-conduct"" from women then advise them first and then if she doesn't listen, then you can refuse to share beds. Then, if she still refuses you can discipline them lightly as the absolute last resort. The extent to which you nitpick verses and try to twist meanings, and interpretations are sad.

Not to mention just a few verses before this:

Qur'an 4:19 ""O believers! It is not permissible for you to inherit women against their will or mistreat them to make them return some of the dowry ˹as a ransom for divorce˺—unless they are found guilty of adultery. Treat them fairly. If you happen to dislike them, you may hate something which Allah turns into a great blessing.""

Furthermore, 

‘Ata said: ""I said to Ibn \`Abbas, what is the kind of hitting that is not harsh? He said, Hitting with a siwak and the like.""

If you look at this hadith it says:

In Sunan Abi Dawud 2144 ""I went to the Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) and asked him: What do you say (command) about our wives? He replied: Give them food what you have for yourself, and clothe them by which you clothe yourself, and do not beat them, and do not revile them.""  
  
If that is not enough then look at this from Sunan Ibn Majah 1851:

""'I enjoin good treatment of women, for they are prisoners with you, and you have no right to treat them otherwise, unless they commit clear indecency. If they do that, then forsake them in their beds and hit them, but without causing injury or leaving a mark.If they obey you, then do not seek means of annoyance against them. You have rights over your women and your women have rights over you. Your rights over your women are that they are not to allow anyone whom you dislike to tread on your bedding (furniture), nor allow anyone whom you dislike to enter your houses. And their right over you are that you should treat them kindly with regard to their clothing and food.' ”",3,5,1680379696.0

jelxtcn,t1_jektf3c,"**The “Controversial” Verse**

Despite the Prophet’s inherent distaste for harm towards women, there has been an attempt to argue for the permissibility of domestic violence based on an interpretation of a specific verse from the Quran (4:34). Contention ultimately arises on the issue of spousal abuse in Islam from a misreading of this particular verse. This verse states that if a husband fears his wife's egregious or defiant behavior, he should follow a three-step procedure to solve the situation.16 First, he must verbally advise her against her actions and correct her mistakes. If this does not improve the situation, he must then ""abandon"" her bed as a display of his disapproval. If that too does not prove effective, then the final measure has been translated as administering a symbolic gesture of physical discipline (ḍaraba). This multi-step procedure was arguably instituted as a means to regulate an initial surge of anger by requiring the husband to essentially cool down and not impulsively inflict harm upon his wife.

On initial reading of this verse, many readers tend to be frustrated with the ostensible permissibility of a husband hitting his wife. For this reason, scholars have discouraged laypersons from seeking legal answers from the Quran unguided as comprehension of the text requires expert interpretation and contextualization.17 In fact, most Muslim sects agree that verses of the Quran can only properly be understood when read in light of other Quranic verses and the Prophetic model, as well as the interpretations and legal implementations of the scholarly elite. It was the scholars of each community who determined how this verse was not only understood, but what consequences could potentially follow if a husband wronged his wife in any way (i.e., physically or mentally).

In reality, the majority of scholars shared the Prophet's aversion to domestic violence and took measures to limit the apparent meaning of ḍaraba or physical discipline in verse 4:34.18 According to the famous early Makkan jurist ʿAṭāʾ ibn Abi Rabah (d. 732 AD), ḍaraba does not refer to hitting at all; rather, it is a symbolic gesture that reflects one’s anger.19 He firmly contended, ""A man does not hit his wife. He simply expresses that he is upset with her.""20 Al-Darimi (d. 869 AD), a prominent early Persian scholar and the teacher of the two most renowned compilers of Prophetic narrations, Bukhari and Muslim, composed an entire chapter of hadith (Prophetic narrations) that objected to domestic violence titled 'The Prohibition on Striking Women.'21 Some scholars even went as far as challenging the authenticity of narrations that supposedly allowed men to hit their wives. Ibn Hajar, a scholar considered a medieval master of hadith, asserted that in spite of the apparent meaning of the Quranic verse, the example set by the Prophet is sufficient proof that hitting one's wife is reprehensible. The nineteenth-century Syrian jurist, Ibn Abidin, moreover, declared that any harm that left a mark on the wife could result in the physical punishment of the husband.22
