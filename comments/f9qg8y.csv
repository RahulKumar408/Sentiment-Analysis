That wasn't Jinnah's dream though. He wanted a secularist but Muslim-majority state that gave freedom and rights to all, including for example his Zoroastrian wife and his Hindu cabinet-member. Why did he want that? 






Because in the 1910's and 1920's Hindutva fanaticists were doing the near-exact same thing that they are doing now in India (burning mosques, lynching people who had beef in their homes, defunding the teaching of Urdu, preventing Ashura marches from happening while all the Hindu festivals were being allowed to shut down cities and create havocs and economic disruption, banning the azaan). 







So Jinnah's vision was for a state of educated Muslims being run secularly (I.E. a defined division between state and Islamic Shari'ah in the way of the post-Tanzimat Devlet-e-Osmaniye, unlike the post-Aurangzeb Gurkhani Sultanat) but with a Muslim-majority state so that it would protect the rights and privileges of Indian Muslims while respecting the rights and privileges of religious minorities.",8,2,1582725340.0

fitpx83,t1_fitnzfs,">That wasn't Jinnah's dream though. He wanted a secularist but Muslim-majority state

No it wasn't. This trope gets repeated quite often here. You can bring up a speech where Jinnah implied he wanted a secular state, others can bring up speeches where he implied he wanted an Islamic state. He was a politician and he played both sides. If he really wanted a secular state, he should've been blunt and not tried to fool anyone. 

Just because you picked the side convenient to you doesn't make it any more true than the other. 

>that gave freedom and rights to all, including for example his Zoroastrian wife

She [converted to Islam](https://www.dawn.com/news/772879) BEFORE they married and went by the name Maryam Jinnah afterwards. Resulting in her being cut off by her family and former community. 

This was pretty basic knowledge. Either you tried to lie, or you're woefully unaware of simple things. That was already evidenced by you point-blank saying he wanted a secular state though.

The Ahamdi/Qadiani belief clearly goes against it and the reason Muslims are against it because in Judism and Christianity they added and subtracted from the word of God whatever was of benefit to them and whatever they deemed ""too strict"" they left it out. And look what happens when you replace the word of God with the word of man, It loses it's spiritual value and doesn't effect the heart of men anymore. As it is evident from the fact that there are so many different versions of bibles and each and every one of them contradict each other and some are omitting one thing and some are others. And this has led to people in western countries leave their religion because they all believe that it is ""man made myth"" etc. 


If we allow this addition and subtraction to fit people's ""wishes"" in Islam then it will inevitably lead down to the same path. You should also know this that Ahamdi/Qadiani belief isn't a ""sect"" of Islam, it wholly and completely goes against one of the fundamentals in Islam which is the finality of Prophethood. 


Therefore in constitution of Pakistan after a lot of debate and extensive research from prominent scholars representing each sect have come to conclusion that Ahamdis/Qadiani cannot be called as Muslims and their place of worship cannot be called a Mosque.

This effectively turns them into non-Muslim minority but this doesn't mean they are second rate citizens without any rights. They have equal rights as Pakistani citizens just like any other non-Muslim religion. And it is wrong to attack their place of worship.

Also Khatam has many meaning, it can be also used to show the rank of someone (ie. Praise someone). Hazrat Ali (ra) was known as Khatam-ul-Auliya. Hazrat Isa (as) was known as Khatam-ul-A'immah etc etc.

It is even reported in Hadiths that Hazoor (saw) stated ""I was Seal of the Prophets (Khataman Nabiyeen) even when Adam was in the elementary stages of his development"" (Mishkat Al Masabih, Musnad Ahmad bin Hanbal, Kanzul Ummal, Kitabul Fitan)

> since they claim there was a Prophet after Muhammad (saw)

No it doesn't. Hazoor (saw) prophesied of a latter-day Messiah and even called him a Nabiyullah 4 times (Sahih Muslim 2937a, not to mention that it also states that latter-day Hazrat Isa (as) would descend directly east of Damascus)! It does not!

> Believe Hazrat Isa (as) died in Kashmir

Let me put it this way: you get a medical degree, you're a doctor. You can now diagnose diseases when people come to you. You still cannot stand at an intersection and discuss people's medical conditions or records.

You and I get to analyze and judge only ourselves. That's the limit of our rights. I don't owe you anything, you don't owe me anything. Especially when it comes to matters of faith.

> get a medical degree, you're a doctor

Lets say there is a person who hasn't got a medical degree, but calls himself a doctor. Does he become a doctor? Is the definition of a doctor changed? Do people who call him out on it (judge him) are wrong and shouldn't judge him because they don't have Ilm-ul-ghaib? 

Everything is not Ilm-ul-ghaib.  Sure, only Allah knows what is in a person's heart but that doesn't mean the definition of a Muslim gets distorted. A person who doesn't believe in the finality of prophethood is not a Muslim whatever he may want to call himself, and it doesn't matter if he has declared this or has kept it hidden in his heart. There are numerous ahadith warning about false prophets and that whoever follows them is not a Muslim. There is a hadith which very clearly states that (the mafhoom) there will not be any prophet after Hazrat Muhammad (Peace be upon Him). Have you heard of Musaylmah Kazzab? How did the Sahaba deal with him? Did they say that only Allah knows what is in his heart so let him be? No? 

Mirza Qadiyani claimed prophethood, which makes his followers non-muslims, as they've pretty clearly ignored a very basic tenet of the Islamic core beliefs.

First, Allah is very clearly telling here that Muhammad is not father of any men so there won't be any case of a prophet coming from his progeny.
