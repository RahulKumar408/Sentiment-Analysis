h9dmsfl,t3_p6a0ag,"As an overseas Pakistani, i see the majority of our youth is not that aware of the situation. Our middle aged generation (at least the majority) is busy finding employment to make their ends meet.

The majority of the generation born and raised in overseas, especially western countries have little to relate with Pakistani politics of socioeconomic problems.

I don't think we should label opinions as local or foreign. Every opinion should be treated as an opinion, and nothing else.

The problem is when that false opinion becomes an international narrative, and that is where the local media is to blame. Our authors, writer, poets, artists, director, actors, religious personalities need to step and and create work of art, such as films and shows, that can help Pakistan create a narrative before India paints a picture for the world.

We need to tell our own stories.

Why are Indians making movies before us, especially on topics like Mughal History, Mohenjo Daro, Ghalib, etc etc. Why haven't we made a single piece of electronic media on our own version of the story and presented it to the world.

We need to realize the power of story telling and use it in creating good films to establish a Pakistani perspective of things. We need to stop copying India in our TV shows and movies.

Reality is overseas Pakistanis have a much better idea of governance & workplace etc then locals which are still mentally 20-30 years behind developed countries. It's quintessential to listen to expats and get their expertise in every field to advance Pakistan forward. China actually did that and developed much faster than any other country in history.

For an example, Balochistan had anti-Punjab movement in 70s and they gladly expelled virtually all punjabi professionals and teachers (my family was part of that expulsion). As a result they got left behind in every single field, now even when they want to get experienced people from punjab to work/teach there people are afraid to go, and now they blame central govt for their under development \*smh\*",0,80,1629231426.0

h9diyr3,t3_p6a0ag,"Local Pakistanis need to understand something instead of always shutting down our opinions.

When you live in a country where things are running much better than they are in Pakistan, you gain a new perspective.

You realize that there are better ways of doing things and of thinking about things.

You become frustrated as you see all the things Pakistan continues to do horribly wrong.

Where is the Land reform? Every country that grew economically did land reforms.

What's up with the education system? A literate and educated population is a must to be competitive.

What kind of country excommunicates an entire sect in their constitution? Nobody does that.

What kind of country fires an economics adviser because Mullahs who don't know the first thing about economics demanded his resignation? This was an international embarrassment.

There are plenty of other Muslim countries. But in those countries, the mullahs don't determine government policy and the government keeps control of them. Extremist clerics are dealt with; not allowed to fester like Pakistan.

We prioritize religion to the point of toxicity. Imran Khan claims to understand the West but he compares Holocaust denial to the prophet being insulted. He embarrassed us on a global stage by saying this stuff.

And finally, democracy doesn't work when your population is illiterate and uneducated.  You need a leader with the actual authority to push through much needed reforms if you want your country to develop. When you are a developing country like Pakistan, you cannot fire a world-class economics adviser because illiterates on the street are demanding it.

So local Pakistanis, understand one thing. When we overseas Pakistanis tell you that Pakistan is a shithole that can do 100x better, that is because we have experienced both Pakistan and other countries. We know that there exists better ways to do things. We love Pakistan and so we want it to be better.

Don't get so offended and maybe listen to what we say. This country is decades behind others and will never catch up if it remains so closed-minded and bigoted.

I know local Pakistanis are going to downvote me heavily because they can't handle constructive criticism of this country and have an overly Rosy view of it.

h9dv9l8,t3_p6a0ag,"I don't doubt the intentions of oversees Pakistanis, but here are a few issues I have found with them:

1. They are not aware of the ground realities of Pakistan and think that their life experiences apply to Pakistan and Pakistanis. A small example of this I saw on this subreddit a while ago was where someone was recommending not buying a car because they lose value as soon and they drive off the lot. Which is true for the west but the reality is the exact opposite in Pakistan.

2. They only hear the rosy promises made by the politicians and do not have to live with the consequences. They fundamentally have a lot less at stake politically and economically than someone whose life is in Pakistan and many of them do not respect that fact.

3. They do not assimilate into the societies they are a part of and look down on them. ""Gorey ghaleez hotey hein"", ""goron ko rishton ki tameez nahi hoti"" etc are things we have all heard. They live in silos and look down on their host countries while also continuing to live there which is just hypocritical and hurts the image of the entire country.

4. They think sending remittance gives them a direct say in the country's politics. Which makes little sense because if the country was doing bad economically they would be the group that would benefit the most from it because of exchange rates. Again, remittance is great for the economy and a necessity even, but it is not sent for the good of the country. That is a welcomed side effect of it.

5. Realted to all of the above, they are in an identity crisis where they are not willing to accept their adopted countries as their own even if they were born there but are also ignorant about life in Pakistan. Which leads to an overt display of patriotism that results in more problems and ignorant opinions that those living in Pakistan find laughable and sometimes offensive.

6. Also, minior grievance, they keep investing in property instead of businesses and drive the cost of land up for the local population which actually needs the land to make homes.

They weren't specifically targeting army associated people (it wasn't a separation thing), any Punjabi was fair game i.e. doctors, teachers etc. Coupled with that the backward ugly mindset of feudal/tribal leaders of even picking up random women from street for their pleasure, my grandfather even stopped girls of the family from going outside the home during that time.

Because of the deteriorating situation in Baluchistan, I don't recall clearly but I think it was the governor of Punjab who offered govt jobs to punjabi people back home. So most of the Punjabis moved back selling out their houses etc at below market rates to just get the hell out.

I've been told this story since childhood, this is why I find it funny when I see posts that central govt is responsible for backwardness in Baluchistan. It's the a55 backwards tribal leaders like Bugti that destroyed the future of Baloch people and stopped them from getting education and progressing.
