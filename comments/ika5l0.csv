Throughout Sindh, the most common type is the infamous Pulao Biryani, its basically pulao wearing a biryani costume.

In the Punjab region, Bombay Biryani is more common. Its the most neutral type of biryani you'll find. 

Apart from these, many varients can be found in the country, I've come across Prawn, Fish, Veg (Which I do not consider to be a biryani), Tikka, Kebab, Nargisi, Hara Masala and others.
