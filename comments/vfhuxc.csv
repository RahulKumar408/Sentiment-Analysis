>Dr. Quratul Ain Hashmi, a resident of Multan (Punjab), was visiting Naltar Valley along with her husband and other family members when she came across the lifeless boy who had drowned and was presumed dead.

Also ALWAY have the head tilted backwards when you blow, so the air doesn't go out of the nose. Lastly.... if you SERIOUSLY break ribs and/or sweating in the first minute  your are doing it right.

I work as a firefighter and one of my first jobs was driving the rescue diver vehicle. When doing CPR on a person that has drowned, the first thing we’ll do is blow air in to the lungs.

They could stand there and not take a video or stand there and take a video. The second option has however small a chance to make a few bucks and the first has zero chance, so they take the second.

I appreciate you taking the time to respond, money might be a factor for some. In this video you can hear the cameraman saying the doctors name and how she saved the boys life. The  doctor is appreciated and will definitely should be appreciated but saying her name out loud at the end made me question the intention of the person taking the video.
