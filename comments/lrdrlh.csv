goo505g,t3_lrdrlh,"I feel terrible for this parent, but is there *actually* any evidence that Nestle was responsible? There seems to be a lot of hate for Nestle in this thread, is there some background or previous scandal I've missed?

Companies making powdered baby milk have been rightly criticised for [implying that their milk is better than breast milk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nestl%C3%A9_boycott), when for most babies , particularly in poorer countries, breast milk is a much better choice. This is the r[esponse from Nestle from around 1999](https://web.archive.org/web/20100516154701/http://www.babymilk.nestle.com/) which seems reasonable. Other than that, I couldn't find anything. 

[EDIT: the [description of this movie, ""Tigers""](https://www.lifegate.com/tigers-movie-denounce-nestle-formula-scandal)  suggests that at least some people in the company *were* at least behaving unethically, though not illegally - that is still the responsibility of the company. Isn't it the government's job to prevent companies behaving in a way that is harmful to its citizens? If baby milk is so harmful, why doesn't the government ban it, they seem to be quick to ban everything else including youtube a few years ago...]

Tragically, babies at that age sometimes die unexpectedly (see [Sudden infant death syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudden_infant_death_syndrome), for no obvious reason. I think it's natural for the dad to look for answers, but any doctor in pakistan will tell you that family will often blame the doctors when something bad happens to their loved one, even when everything possible was done. Obviously, sometimes the doctors *did* do something wrong, my point is you can't tell just from the fact that someone made an accusation.

Isn't it weird that there was forensic analysis of the body, but *not the milk*? That would be much more of a smoking gun, which makes me think is was negative. How long after death the body was exhumed is also probably relevant - in pakistan there is usually only a cloth shroud, not a wooden coffin, so contamination of the body with material from the dirt around the body is highly likely - could that have contained the pesticide?

[This report from last year](https://www.facebook.com/khabarwala.pk/posts/fir-registered-against-nestle-pakistan-for-babys-death-due-to-poisonous-formula-/2354005448167419/) and a statement from nestle pakistan says that they were given a sample of the milk that was allegedly given to the child, and their tests suggest it was NOT their formula. Now it would be naive to believe that without independent tests, but it suggests the father still had access to the milk, so why wouldn't they also send *that* to the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for testing? You can bet that if they had and it came up positive, it would be in this FIR, which suggests they didn't send it, or the test came up negative which completely undermines this case. 

Also, who here thinks the Pakistani Police services are professional and always committed to justice? Anyone? How likely do you think it is that the exhumation and forensic examination was carried out by the police forensic department themselves, with a fully-documented ""chain of evidence""? If not, Nestle will easily win this case, because there are so many ways for the toxins to have been introduced at some point in that chain. 

Even the whole ""Nestle made death threats"" or ""Nestle threatened the dad"" thing - have you seen any *evidence* for this, other than the dad just saying it? 

If the *facts* show that Nestle was responsible, I'm all in favor of punishing them to the full extent of the law. But if any of us was accused of something, we would want to be considered ""innocent until proven guilty"" - why wouldn't we want the same for this company and its management?",0,0,1614227152.0
