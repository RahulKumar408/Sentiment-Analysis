The Koran‚Äôs teachings are better represented  in Western societies than in Islamic countries, which have failed to  embrace the values of their own faith in politics, business, law and  society, a leading academic at George Washington University has said.

A study of 208 countries and territories has  found that the top countries in both economic achievement and social  values are Ireland, Demark, Luxembourg and New Zealand. Britain also  ranks in the top ten.

The first Muslim-majority nation is Malaysia ranking at 33, while the only other state in the top 50 is Kuwait at 48.",3,6,1620525601.0
