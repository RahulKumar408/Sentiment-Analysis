99% of what you said I'd agree with bar the point ""imagine serving 60 years of your life to get a house/plot in the end"". This statement makes it look like those who're not serving in the Army, mere civil or private sector servants are NOT sweating enough to deserve a house by the end of their service? 
Bro you're right we shouldn't demonize the army but when kal ka kaptaan can pull you over on a public road and threaten you by ""wahan gaarh dun ga jahan se kabhi kisi ko milo gay bhi nahin"" wali threats. Its about the lack of accountability for them officers, obviously due to army's supremacy over law of the land.

iba5amc,t3_v5jbyi,"Pakistan got independence in 1947

Pakistan lost independence in 1958

East Pakistan Realized this problem the hard way and fought back fiercely and became independent in 1971

West Pakistan remain under military dictatorship that has puppet government to keep people distracted from this reality so that they don't revolt. I would say they are the most genius dictatorship ever to exist in history of the world. Probably because they learned from their mistakes in East Pakistan and became too subtle for ordinary people to notice. We are oppressed by the same force, just that they became smarter and bigger.

Just to clarify, we are not talking about the ordinary soldiers here. Not even officers. We are talking about the top most three rank layers of the Army. They are the beneficiaries of this system.

Ordinary soldiers and officers are just ordinary people like us, who just take orders from the top and does their job. They are good people who protect us, but we are talking about those who have houses in London, or business chains in America. They take advantage of the Martyrdom of brave soldiers and market it to the Awaam while behind the scene making billions in corrupt money.

No matter which govt comes, they all are Army's puppets. They exist as an illusion of choice. Sure, Imran Khan may have good intentions, but he himself has admitted that he did not have full power and he too have to work as a puppet. And as we all saw, he was replaced. The current govt is also puppet, but now more people realize it now.

And I bet they will bring Imran Khan again next year or whenever we start protesting big against current govt. This is all just a distraction to keep the public under control. And unless Imran Khan uses his popularity to properly expose this system, there is no way out other than a full on revolution.

Currently entire Pakistan exists as a business venture that makes them consistent profits, which they save up in foreign countries as they don't like the quality of life here. For them, Pakistan is just their temporary house you take on rent near your office. They only care enough to keep their business protected. They will do anything to protect their profits just like East India company.

Now there is a slim chance this could change. Currently, the prices of everything is rising. This will affect a large enough population to rise up and see the full picture. This is the biggest threat to Dictatorships.

Due to a shrinking Economy, the Army is finding it increasingly difficult to make as much corruption money as they used to. Their illegal business profits are also down. Thus you will see cracks appearing as it become difficult for them to keep their own people in control due to lesser and lesser corruption money to divide.

We all need to understand that it is not just Bajwa. You see, you cannot have a dictatorship with just you as a king. You need a system of people to work for you. And you have to pay them to keep them loyal to you. And, they are not expecting ""salaries"" but instead billions in corrupt money. So, when they see their money decrease, they may start fighting or throwing a tantrum.

And due to recent political circumstances, it is possible that people may get a chance to fight and change such the regime. Ask yourself - Is this what so many freedom fighters including Jinnah fought hard for?

You all are educated, atleast enough to read English. Many of you are even in foreign countries in powerful positions. It is your duty to spread the truth and inform other citizens about these issues as many are unfortunately not educated enough to research and understand all of these. You can do however you want. Tell your friends, make memes like this, make videos, write if you can, put it in whatsapp groups etc.

So, this is the least you could do for your country. I am doing my part. You too do yours. Together, we can change the system bit by bit.",0,130,1654455495.0

Also not all officers are given so much land aa people like to blow out of proportions here, a lot of it even though, alotted to them are just a means of later reselling in order to build their retirement home at a plot or two.

Do you people lack some serious brain cells? Then what is the incentive of people joining the Armed Forces , doing a fuckin' service to the country , huh?

People are slowly forgetting the line between demonizing Pakistani Army as an institute and those few gen. People actually hate. Just remember, if it werent for the army , that you people are trying so hard to defame and pressurize , Pakistan would've been fragmented into a thousand pieces already. So , learn to not defame the entire pakistan Army , just take ur vent out on some of the generals and move on.

The post was good, wasn't it? We do need such realizations for the upcoming generation although we may still not know how to come out of it. Ashir Azeem in few of his vlogs mentions a way such as dissolving the 111-brigade, merging rangers with police and so on.. but honestly its only something I can dream about.",5,1,1654623356.0

ibkamb9,t1_ibigtf7,"Bro i'll be honest with you. I'm 32 and have moved overseas since the past few years but like many others, my heart bleeds for our country. I've only recently started following current affairs since IK's ousting but have always heard about this shadowy establishment since early childhood. I'm more of an idealist and in a way naive too, but I won't stop dreaming about the good things our country can become.

As for the video, it ""should"" be similar to whistle blowing documentaries that are hard to swallow eye openers as they are the best mediums in the recent day and age to allow the masses to wake up. 

In the larger picture, I believe it's all down to Allah's plan when truth will reign over falsehood but I'm definitely sure it will come out of common people as vessels rather than a miraculous overnight shift. 

Regarding how the video should be, I believe it should start from the beginning, i.e. the creation of Pakistan and should cover the eras of each leader and what they added to/subtracted from the equation. Should be done in episodes, with citations, references and interviews of whoever can contribute to/reinforce the narrative. 

For this I may have to read a plethora of books I suppose, or come across individuals like you who have, hopefully, already done a lot of reading.",5,2,1654655700.0

I'm new to the show, (I thought final season means the ending of the show lol) I decided to give the first episode a go, I like it, and then binge watched the whole series (including the ova's) just to find out there's still one season left...

ibkut2y,t1_ibkamb9,"Great. Awesome. I will surely provide you material for the video. I don't suggest to over-produce too, because when you try to do that, nothing progresses and project hit a dead-end. Make it in such a way that you can release atleast one video per week. One it is popular, you can add more quality. Interviews and all are hard when you are just starting for example.

Start quickly on some simpler topic instead of waiting forever to be perfect.

Let’s throw all our support, hope and expectations behind that one person that he/she’ll fix all our problems. Let’s obsess over them and create a larger than life persona of that person. When they turn out to be the same as all the other previous leaders we’ve had, we can start waiting and wishing all over again for the next new ‘saviour’ of Pakistan.
