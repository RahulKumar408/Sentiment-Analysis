hk8eqsy,t3_qrqld7,"All of them were briliiant throughout the tournament. Boys played well. Hasan Ali definitely should have caught the ball and maybe the result could have changed but I feel our bowling in the middle and death overs was average and that made us lose the match.  He's not the only one to blame. Also we were atleast 15 runs short I believe. 

Babar and Rizwan give good starts but I feel the rest of the batsmen dont capitalize the good opening start. Our openers have been saving us. Fakhar is good for odi/Tests but not T20s. He scored today and was brilliant but he's not a consistent powerhouse. He takes too much time to get into the groove and start hitting. Those sixes he hits are beautiful to look at btw. Haris Rauf was fine. Better than expected. Shoaib Malik is absolutely useless against big teams. Minnow basher at best. I dont think he deserved his place on the team. 

Asif Ali did what he was best at but I feel we shouldnt reduce him to just a finisher. Give him proper guidance and make him come at number 4 position. Taking 1s and 2s is just as important and when the moment is right score those big sixes. Shadab was good. I dont really have complaints against him as a bowler but I wish his batting was better. Imad is just there. Makes no difference whatsoever. Hafeez this tournament was fine. As always his bowling was economical but wish he lasted longer during batting.",0,3,1636655802.0

hk8bv59,t3_qrqld7,"I think the comments blaming Hassan Ali are kind of overboard. Yes that was a mistake that potentially could have changed the match but we don't really know. We have to remember that Australia dropped 2 or 3 regulation catches you while we batted. We have also had more than one match where we lost wickets and were in a losing position and then Asif Ali shows up and starts hitting from the first ball and makes us win.

We had 2 main issues imo. In this tournament we have seen that chasing 189 or 190 is still possible, defending 175 against Australia was always hard. New Zealand beat England this way too and I'm sure if we were chasing we would have beaten Australia too. So we were short about 20 runs if we really stood a chance to defend and secondly our no balls really hurt us today. I think we have the most no balls in the tournament but the other matches we didn't get punished for it as much. Today we had multiple no balls that were boundaries and free hits that weren't dot balls or singles. It takes away too much scoreboard pressure. 

So imo there are areas we should have done better. But overall they played way better than expected before the tournament began and we shouldn't lose sight of that and continue to build on it, hopefully in our ODI squad too.",0,5,1636654654.0

Hasan hasn't performed but you cant just blame him or drop him because of this tournament. No wonder we can't get a stable team",6,-1,1636657439.0
hk8ci7w,t1_hk8bs7w,Ramiz has been good in PCB and he seems like a real reformist. The culture needs to be changed inside PCB. An in-form Amir with Shaheen will be a devastating duo.,7,5,1636654911.0
hk8jwwi,t1_hk8itqs,"Ok man, Fakhar had an sr of 170 and his sixes near the end were what gave us a sliver of hope of being able to defend but I guess that‚Äôs not ‚Äúcarrying‚Äù the team enough.

A stable team where a pace bowler consistently doesn‚Äôt perform up to the mark isn‚Äôt going to do much. We shouldn‚Äôt drop Hasan after this tournament sure, but he should definitely be out on thin ice. Can‚Äôt consistently eat bad performances in the name of stability. The rest of the team is stable enough where they can play some new faces and find new talent now.",7,4,1636657877.0
