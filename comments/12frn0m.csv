that's not saying there aren't PTI cultist there most certainly are braindead PTI supporters i.e. the lot who have accepted IK as their Peer-o-Murshid  


but they are a minority. I literally know people who have been to PTI rallies and got even tear gassed but would still cuss and swear at IK and say the only reason for their support is because he is the least foul individuals among the pile of shit that we call pakistan's political class",3,10,1680985022.0
jfhsmr9,t1_jfh0l2w,"> They almost left him.

That does not equate to holding it accountable. Would you still consider it accountability if IK had left the panama troupe alone after it was leaked and hoped they somehow convict themselves? If your answer is ""No"", how can leaving PTI on its own fix the mistakes by the party itself then? 

The point is that this is a lazy man's approach which is not very effective. Just look at the situation now, all those people who got enraged over IK's choice of coalitions and vowed to not vote for PTI, their ""input"" doesn't hold any ground now, does it? PTI is going into the next election with the likes of Elahi et al. and these very supporters will have to vote questionable people just to get IK back in power because other parties are worse. So basically, the lazy approach is filling PTI with the similar set of people as other parties, to the point where if IK is no more, PTI is the same as other parties, and internally elects someone with a weak morality, and guess what, we are back to square one where not a single party is worth voting for.

TL;DR: Don't leave your support to PTI if you are frustrated. Instead get answers from IK the way IK moved his a$$ and got answers out of the panama guys.",3,3,1680989016.0

 People have been so disillusioned with the establishment parties for so long that once a genuinely viable alternative came forth people have jumped on it. Then the way they ousted PTI and their behaviour in the subsequent period until now has only catalysed it further. People who never had any interest in politics are now jumping in for PTI because they've seen how low the establishment parties are willing to go just for power and to keep their way of life intact.
