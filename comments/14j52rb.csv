On another note I am a Overseas Pakistani and was always told everything is a scam. I was in National hospital in Lahore and was advised by the Drs to stay the night so I can be seen by the Dr in the morning. I checked in and if I remember my room fee was 16,500 rs. Morning came no Dr came to see me and was told the Dr had left at 12pm midday. I decided to check out but before I did I asked for the PR office and was told to wait 5 mins and would be called inside. When I went inside, the PR officer was a Army Colonel. I sat down and explained my disappointment with what had happened to me while here ( not expecting anything). He picked up the phone and called the Ward I stayed in and asked for the Dr on duty. Both Drs where not available and had left. He was angry, apologized and was embarrassed at what had happened. He thanked me for raising this issue because he said most people rant and rave then leave and the right people are not informed. We had a pleasant discussion but agreed it is unacceptable.My total bill was 23,000rs ( medicine and drip charges included) he asked for my bill and removed the amount of 17,000rs( some tax added) and I only paid 6,000rs for my medicine I had purchased and the drip. My whole point is that sometimes ranting and arguing with these people is not the way. Maybe there is a correct procedure to follow ( maybe not) but you need to try and speak to the right people only then you will get the right answers.

2. No or poor understanding of Inflation. I have relatives who gloat about how X plot has risen Y amount. Yet a simple calculation shows theres nothing to gloat about. Its all in their heads.

3. They want to avoid tax. So benefit fraud is a real thing (dont @ me with the UK stereotypes) and I see most people who get hooked on that stuff unwillingly to let go. The result is they have to hide the money and ergo do so in Pakistan. Its so obnoxious you have benefit claimants here go back home to these lavish “Kotis” and laud it over the people back there yet the reality is very different.
