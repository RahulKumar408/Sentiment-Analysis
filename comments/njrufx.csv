gza2ro8,t3_njrufx,"This sub only remembers COVID when it’s convenient for them lmao. There were a lot of rallies before this that were in support of Palestine. Now that a religious party organizes one, now you remember COVID? Even though it was this protest that Ismail Haniyah, an actual Palestinian leader, acknowledged and gave a speech at. 

Also to all the idiots saying the protest was “too late”, is Palestine free yet? Did Israel stop killing children? The IDF attacked al-Aqsa not even 24 hours after the supposed ceasefire. 

To all the people saying “mUh eConOmY”; somethings are more important. Humanity, Muslim brotherhood, human decency, taqwa, these things are more important. 

To everyone saying “what’s the point”, you clearly don’t understand why people demonstrate and protest and march. This march was to show solidarity with Palestinians. It was to put political pressure on our leaders to actually do something instead of talking. It was to make an appeal to the public to support Palestinians with their tongues and their pockets and wealth. 

That’s why people march, that’s why people protest. Maybe it won’t work. Maybe it was all for naught. But when Allah ‎ﷻ‬ asks on the day of judgement, at least I can say I tried. At least I can say that I showed up and I spoke out. 

I’m cynical but this sub always takes cynicism to the extreme when there’s a religious element involved. That doesn’t matter.

gzbclwr,t1_gza4r3i,">	Now let’s get to the real issue, you so called “religious people” are clearly doing this for posturing, to show dominance.

Is this a joke? The rally was held for solidarity. This is obvious from the fact that Jamaat Islami had Shias and Christians speaking on stage. It was the largest demonstration in support of Palestine, and if you were actually there you’d know that there were a lot of non-religious people there as well. Not to mention the fact that JI got Ismail Haniyah who addressed the protestors. How was this for political posturing? JI invited multiple politicians from opposing parties and other religious parties. If it was for posturing, why would they do so? The Palestinian issue is a Muslim issue. This fact is what we’ve been saying and what Hafiz Naeemurrahman and Siraj alHaq repeated. 

On Thursday, liberals held a pro Palestinian rally in Karachi in front of Karachi Press Club. Where was the outrage then? Aurat March was held during the peak of the COVID wave. Did this sub condemn that rally? Why then is the only controversial demonstration the one held by Jamaat Islami? 

It’s obvious that this sub is dissonant from the general population of Pakistan.

The only reason Pakistanis (government and people) are beating their drums is because it makes them feel and look good without any long term blow back. Pakistan has no diplomatic or economic relations with Israel. Everyone goes out to protest against Israel and pat themselves on the back about a job well done. These protests are there just so people feel good about themselves (i.e. selfish reasons). Politicians make all these statements because the public likes them. Zero practical action is taken. Rhetorical speeches in front of the UN mean nothing. 

However, we ignore the same behaviour from our allies or places where we might be told to out our money where our mouth is. 

Pakistan/Iran/Turkey politicians are calling for a international observation force in Palestine because they know it will never happen. However, they do get brownie points from their public. How come there wasn't a peep about a force from any of these countries when the Rohingya genocide was being committed?

You say the first priority is to care for humanity and to hell with the economy. Why is it that out government does not say any about the persecution of the Kurdish people in Turkey. Our public is completely silent on the matter as well. Before you parrot the Turkish line of saying the Kurds are terrorists I would suggest you read up on Kurdish oppression in Turkey. 

You may call what I am saying whataboutism. However, I call the stance of out government and people hypocrisy. Somehow, oppression and ethnic cleansing only apply to counties we are in opposition of, never our allies or countries where we may be expected (have the power) to actually take practical action!

The majority (if not all) of the current Arab royal families fought against the Ottomans. House of Saud being a prime example. 
Saud, incidentally being the last person to march in Makkah with the intention of attacking it. This is after Hussein bin Ali (of the Jordanian royal family) refused to ratify the Treaty of Versailles (after having himself attacked Makkah to remove the Ottomans).
