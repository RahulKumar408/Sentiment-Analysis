gtwahie,t3_mmqxct,"I had the pleasure of debating against her and her twin brother in a school debate tournament. Both of them are visually impaired since birth. During a debates match, you're supposed to write down notes about what your opponent's arguments are. She was able to retain all our arguments in her memory and take us down one argument at a time. I was absolutely amazed by her intelligence and ability to tackle our arguments. Our team lost the match by a huge margin but I was just happy that I met an inspiring human being such as her. We talked a bit afterwards. 
Later on, we got our asses handed to us by her brother who was just as sharp as her. He's got a ted talk by the way

gtt98jj,t1_gtt8pe6,"Malala didn’t push herself on a pedestal, she just did what she believed in. It was the BBC at the time who pushed her to the spotlight.

Once on the pedestal of course she’s an asset to the country’s image. Whether she is deserving of such an honour is up for debate and is quite irrelevant at this point. 

What people complain about and I am complaining about is that there are many people in Pakistan who are like malala or better than Malala but never get the spotlight.",3,1,1617891222.0

you: “just leave the country like I did.” 

See how it makes no sense whatsoever to what altaf said? We’re not asking you if you left the country ? It’s not an airport? your departure is of no consequence. The conversation is : how can Pakistan help itself ? 

You answered : “by idiots like me leaving the country.”

You could literally say that about anyone, even the so called people that you think deserve it more. Do you think if someone better than Malala got the recognition that Pakistanis would stop shitting on that person saying that there are other Pakistanis that are more deserving of the spotlight?

For me personally malala is my sister I want all the good for her. She’s doing all she can to use her platform to bring goodness.

This isn’t about Malala or pakis hating on other pakis. You’re projecting something into my statement that doesn’t exist.

My hate is against the media and specifically the western “establishment”.",5,1,1617931028.0

gtw6dl4,t1_gtvpc5v,"I get your point and at some point I would have agreed with you but I have yet to see what political purpose she has served for the Western establishment. She continues to advocate for education for all children, especially for refugees and those in conflict zones. She has always dressed in traditional Pakistani clothes; she could have shed her dupatta and clothes for more Western liberal clothing or raged against conservative and modest Pakistani clothing like many Western-educated Pakistani liberals have already done.

She has cited her love for Pakistan and how she feels proud to be Pakistani. She’s stated that she’s a proud and practicing Muslim. She’s even stated her outright support for the people of Kashmir and their right to self-determination earning her ire from many circles in India, and has cited people like Bacha Khan and Allama to Iqbal as inspirations. 

I’m just failing to see what she’s doing that is about to further the political aspirations of the Western establishment.",6,2,1617940477.0
