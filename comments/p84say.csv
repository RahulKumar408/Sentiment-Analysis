3) Behaviours are our socialization to our environment and social groups, such as families in Pakistan don't teach this kind of behaviour.

So then it begs the question, where do the peers fathom the idea to harass members of society as if it were their birth given right.

This is similar to how we say to our kids ""mera acha beta khana zaya nahin krta"", chahay us ki adat ho. Or how we say ""real men don't rape"". They are obviously men and obviously rapists. But then we define something good to be part of identity and in order to be a ""real"" man, instead of a pathetic excuse of a man, you respect women. This is because people seem to protect and live by their identity.

I am not advocating for denying the problem. I'm just asking to look at this language from a different angle, and possibly keep using it while also raising awareness. Not in response to such incidents, but maybe when there is something good being shared e.g. something wholesome where people help other people and we say ""this is our Pakistan"".

h9yf1y8,t1_h9y4z03,"Patriarchy is the how societies make men responsible for the weak and vulnerable in a society. Men have to be providers and protectors. Prior to the advent of nation states, the state/ruler was not very involved with people’s day to day lives, men had to be responsible for EVERYTHING. Healthcare, protection, provisioning, safety. This is the only form of assigning social functions that has produced stability in human societies. Look at it this way, with out patriarchy human society could not have been able to organize and bring us where we are today. But the side effect of patriarchy is too much power for the male, and while the women and children are weak and vulnerable, they kind of had to rely on males cz women’s economic utility was very limited prior to the Industrial Age, Islamic patriarchy designs rules which men shall not exceed, effectively limiting the power men can hold. 

Modern day nation states have replaced the functions men used to perform. Better policing, social safety nets, healthcare, providing a robust economy for women can provide for themselves without having to work labor intensive jobs etc. You’d think that is a good thing. Right? And in many senses it is a good thing, but this has allowed individualism to seep into societies. When u don’t rely on men and the community men come together to make up for your access to resources, safety and provisions, u no longer have an incentive to conform to social norms. You are your own person. Your relationship is not with the community anymore. Yo relationship is with the all powerful state. That’s fine and all, but this also deteriorates social cohesion. Because when individuals no longer adhere to the same values and cultural expressions, people no longer identify u as your own. As a result crimes sky rocket. Individualists find it hard to compromise so marriages fail a lot more. More childrenare born out of wedlock and raised in broken homes, which also leads to more crimes. Individualists breed less, so their nation has to import more foreign labor, essentially starting the long process of replacing the host population, because each year, locals will breed less, have less marriages and each year more foreign labor will have to be brought in. People’s morality will be dictated by the state and the family structure will continue to deteriorate.  

In order for the state to continue to fulfill the role males used to fulfill, the state requires strong institutions. Strong institutions need to be well funded. Funding comes from taxes and taxes come from people. But if a society’s population is in a decline, less people pay taxes, hence the need for continued growth of economy and continued import of foreign labor, continued need for burning through this planet’s limited resources. Continued destruction of the oceans, continued deforestation. Continued extractions of the earths resources at increasingly accelerated rates. 

I don’t have to tell you why these things are bad. We are seeing 1st hand how we our destroying our societies and the planet. The patchwork with renewables is slow and in many cases requires us to rape the planet even further. In order to address climate change, we have to dig for expensive natural resources resources that are already in a limited supply. The fast economic growth also means we are using more than our fair share of resources, because we have the buying power to do so. All of these societal and global problems are growing and getting worse partly because progressive nations tried to replace patriarchy.

Norway: Oil

Sweden: Sweden's natural resources include gold, silver, iron ore, copper, lead, zinc, tungsten, uranium, arsenic, and feldspar. The mining sector of the country has been active with mineral resources **forming the basis of the economy.**The major mineral-rich mining regions in Sweden are the Norrbotten and Skellefte districts.

Or atheist modi wouldn’t change his policies at all because the uneducated majority is voting him in because of his Hindu supremacy because power > all morals
