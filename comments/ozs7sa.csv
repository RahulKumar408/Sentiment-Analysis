h84x0ft,t3_ozs7sa,"Greatest sports achievement by a Pakistani athlete. Track and field is brutally, tough and competitive. Every country plays this sport unlike the case in cricket, hockey, tennis, squash. No weight category as well. And historically desis have struggled in athletics. 

In USA every high school has javelin throwers with dedicated coaches, same is true in all sporting powerhouses. 5th in the final means Nadeem is the 5th best on the planet, in a sport that enjoys wide participation. He did this without sufficient govt support, makes it all the more impressive. Invest in him, have faith in him, send him to train in Germany or USA, I am sure he will finish on the podium in Paris Olympics.
