If someone genuinely holds hateful views for our war veterans, then I will agree with you on that.

However, if we are talking about the events from the last few days, after Imran Khan was abducted, those statues and pictures ceased to signify the bravery of our martyrs. 

They were targeted because, for the ordinary man, in the heat of the moment, they symbolized markers of an oppressive force that has repeatedly intervened to create problems for the common man.

Two fallacies. 

False equivalence and Strawman.

The military has a chain of command. You have to obey what your senior tells you. Therefore, in effect, the military does exactly what Asim Munir tells it to. The Army Chief can mold the military however he wishes to.
