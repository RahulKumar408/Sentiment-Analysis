If China withdrew support now, because Pakistan opposed them, the consequences would be catastrophic. Pakistan would slowly descend into an economic collapse as all of the investments in places such as Gwadar and all the infrastructure would come to a halt, and the loans China has given to Pakistan will probably be demanded back, and Pakistan would be left to collapse. It was a deal done by nawaaz sharif, that was probably not as good for Pakistan as it couldve been and probably shouldnt have even happened if he, or other corrupt runners, weren't in power.

Pakistanis, and I assume, other muslims from similar background countries have a dual problem. They have an inferiority complex when it comes to the white man. But also a superiority complex when it comes to non-white people, especially blacks, Indians and Hispanics. We also have a terrible understanding of all of these demographic groups. The white man is this perfect species that can do no wrong. And for some reason, there is this weird idea that every white person is a devout christian, and is super into religion. This is NOT true, especially in bigger states like NY and California. Hardly anyone even visits church anymore and most people are strongly secular, preferring not to discuss religion with others. 

The admiration for the white man is accompanied with an equal amount of contempt for Indians. I can't believe how much hatred expat Pakistanis have for Indians. Even though they are community most similar to us, and having a lot of common issues and goals. It is actually just a veil for jealousy though. Most indians are very well to do, working in high paying jobs such as software and doctors. They have homes most Pakistanis can only dream of owning. So the automatic assumption is that they must have ""cheated"" their way to success. Fun fact though, almost every pakistani who works in the motel or gas station business cheats on their taxes here. They hide cash income, so that they can get government benefits, as well as lowering their tax income. The rationale is ""we are poor hard working immigrants, and we deserve to keep our money"", even if they have been their for 2p years and own 5 gas stations.

The verse directly before says:
>Except for those among the polytheists with whom you had made a treaty, and did not violate any of its terms, nor aided anyone against you. So fulfill the treaty with them to the end of its term. God loves the righteous.

Clearly this is talking about those who violated the peace treaty with the muslims and attacked them. You can see this in 9:1

If you had ever picked up a quran in your life you would know this

>And if they cease, then indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful.

Clearly talking about people who attacked the muslims first

When they thought of marching back to Madinah, Allah Almighty filled their hearts with such awe and fear that they could not muster the courage to do so**. The most they could do was to hire a Madinah-bound villager to go there and tell Muslims that theu were coming back. But, this whole deal came into the knowledge of the oly Prophet (p) in Madinah through revelation. He marched to Hamra al-Asad to apprehend them but they had already run away from there. This was the background in which the present verse was revealed.”

The national government hasnt done much in anyway to be called pro-minority. Maybe in their heart they are. But action matters. You cant just change things with good will. Why is it that Ahmedis have to be humiliated by forcing the muslims to call Mirza Ghulam Ahmed a liar. Why is there more outrage from IK on the France end when the minorities in this country are suffering. And he is silent. He can actually do something about the minorities in Pak, instead he is writing love letters to Zuck and OIC. If I was a minority I wouldnt care as much about a temple or whether foreigners can visit their shrines in Pakistan. I would however care that nobody is calling my prophet a liar and that my daughters arent being kidnapped and raped while the judges get fat from bribes.


> Maybe we should be like France, if you see a woman in an abaya then the police should be allowed to put a gun to her head and strip her naked for muh republic.

No you are right, We should remain as we are. Where children get kidnapped and raped by men more then 3 times their age while the judges rule in favor of the rapist. Its almost like there is a middle road between the two cases. Which is where we should strive to be. But whenever anyone gives justified criticism, people like you show up acting like all is good in Pakistan because muh katarpur.

Only a dumbass or someone looking to malign Islam would take that out of context. If you read the actual surah and not just a a specific line, you'd understand. But I forget, the entirety of your knowledge consists of the sentence ""Islam bad"" and a couple of misinformed posts on an Islamophobic sub or website.

Basically you're saying that you're not gonna look into the thing you're condemning? Pretty bleak mindset you got there. It would be at least worth debating if you even had the slightest knowledge on anything you're talking about. 

>Luckily for me my parents didn't abuse me like that.
Unfortunately, your parents haven't seemed to have guided you in the slightest and have left you to find everything on your own. And instead of making educated decisions and condemnations, you decided, ""oh hey! I read islam bad, so islam bad!""

*If* Pakistan treats its minorities like shit, then yes it should stop. But it does not. Minorities have reserved seats in parliament and a quota in government jobs **greater** then their share in population. Please tell me of any western government having this.

Where minorities are harmed, it’s not due to the state. And minorities getting harmed by people happens all over the world (which does not make it okay) in states far stronger than Pakistan. Just look at all the knife attacks on Muslims in France and stuff like that. And they aren’t things being done by some group having links to foreign intelligence agencies and black water like TTP.

> When you have a province ruled by those that don't care, people will commit abuse.

Again. As I said. Its not just Sindh. Things like that happen in Punjab aswell. Theres also the bachabazi culture (which is not against minority but its still abuse) in KPK. Theres the tribal laws in Balochistan (which are hell for the women there) aswell. No province in Pakistan is free from absolute savagery. So stop trying to make this a Sindh issue and acting like all is good everywhere else when this is quite clearly a Pakistan issue. What have other parties done to stop the issues I mentioned in their provinces.

 
> Hardly the case that this government is hell bent on hurting religious sentiments of minorities.

As I have said. I dont think that this government is against minorities. I mean there are MNA members from PTI like Ali Muhammad Khan and Noorul Haq Qadri, who have made it their lifes mission to demonise Ahmedis. But I do agree that IK, Asad, Fawad and Shireen Mazari atleast care about minority rights. But as I said. They are in power now. They could have tried to force their way through. In Pakistan oppositions have always tried to make life hell for the sitting govt. IK did it too. Which is his right. But does that mean that you fold your arms and start acting impotent whenever you meet resistance.


> It feels like you think we should just stay silent when our religion is attacked or when muslims are unfairly targeted.

I didnt say that. Tell me where I said that. I just said that you shouldnt press the 'X' button whenever you face justified criticism. We live in Pakistan, we are responsible for protecting minorities. But IK recently has been going all out with his letters. Did he comment on the Arzoo case. Has he done anything for Ahmedi rights since he has been in office. I mean he can say all he wants about how muslim sentiments are hurt. And thats ok, cuz muslims do have a right to feel hurt. But what about the hurt sentiments of Ahmedis when people call their prophet fake or liar. IK is the only one who can do something about that. The fact that he would rather care about foreign issues rather than solving issues back home just shows that he doesnt care as much as he would like us to think.


The last couple laws that were passed by the govt had to do with adding khatam-e-nabuwat after Prophets name and not drawing prophets caricatures. Tell me which dumbass in Pakistan is brave enough to draw a caricature. Tell me is that what the govt should be prioritizing. Obviously no. But these are the only bills being brought forward and the only bills being passed.

> If you truly believe that the government isn't doing right by minorities then I cordially invite you to vote for the opposition who hate the fact that a temple is being built in Islamabad or that money was """"""wasted"""""" on Kartarpur.


Just because I criticize IK. Doesnt mean I support opposition. The opposition in Pakistan are utter trash. And anybody who votes for them needs a lobotomy. But that doesnt mean that I cant say that the current govt isnt doing enough when it could be. Im not a nationalist nor do I have party loyalty, though I am a patriot who wants change in pakistan and for that I do have the right to criticize the person I voted for.
