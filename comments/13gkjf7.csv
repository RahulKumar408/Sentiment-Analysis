I mean one can argue about the method of arrest but if the court seems it necessary to have him arrested for the Al Qadir Trust case, then what's the issue ? I thought we were against corruption ? Or is it okay for Imran to be corrupt but not okay for everyone else ?  
Also how are you reconciling with Imran's hypocrisies ?   
Exhibit 1. He himself admitted to using agencies to get bills passed in the NA  
Exhibit 2. He himself admitted that Bajwa used to come to him with dirt on his opponents ?  
So was that all Halal for our Sadiq And Ameen ?   
Seriously I do not understand this at all. Are we okay with the Army interfering as long as it is against Imran's opponents ? He himself said ""They are afraid If a good Army Chief comes, he will go after their corruption"" (paraphrased but that's kind of what he said). Since when is it the Army Chief's job to go after corruption ? and why was Imran seemingly okay with that idea ? According to his own standards, if the Army Chief is coming after him for ""corruption"" than why is not okay now ?  
And the whole "" I made Pakistan so famous when you weren't even born"" argument, is the stupidest pettiest dumbest thing I have heard from a 70 year old. It reeks of ego and nothing more.

jk2a0e8,t1_jk26pi2,"Buddy, why don't you do some research instead of believing in a partisan hack like Wajahat.
It is well documented that the ARU approached NCA UK to investigate 1-Hyde Park which led them to Malik Riaz and his 190 Million Pounds of assets. Which they froze and after about a year of investigation, Malik Riaz chose to settle the matter with them. Shahzad Akbar who was in the ""ARU"" brokered the deal between Malik Riaz and Pak Gov with Imran Khan's blessings and signatures. The NCA gives any assets it recovers back to the state, this time the money was transferred directly to the SC account as part of Malik Riaz's fine instead of the national exchequer.
I will reiterate all of this is well documented. There are press conferences from Shahzad Akbar and Fawad Chaudary where they defend Malik Riaz by making the good ol' ""it's a civil case not a criminal case"" excuse and when asked why the money is in SC saying ""SC is also part of gov"".",4,-6,1684024272.0

jk3d24p,t1_jk38tg3,"""the agency was due to transfer this seized property along with all other seized assets to the state of Pakistan including any proceeds raised from the sale of any assets""
NCA sends any and all assets its recovers back to the state not the individual as that would make no sense. So what you are saying is proven wrong by the very article you have shared.
As for Pak being a party to the settlement or not, Pak might not have been present officially during the settlement negotiations. But Shahzad Akbar, the Special Assistant to the PM, sent a doc to Imran Khan which was approved by the cabinet without even opening it. Shireen Mazari has objected to the said doc on the record.
Not to the mention the money was sent straight to the SC account and Shahzad Akbar is on the record for defending it by saying that ""SC is also part of Pakistan"".
Pakistani Gov approved the transfer of money to SC account hence why it was sent to the SC account. Otherwise it should have been in the national exchequer. The state bank !",6,1,1684049655.0

They would have simply exonerated him of any charges and unfrozen his assets like they did with Shahbaz and his son Suleman i think.  
Settlement means Malik Riaz lost and agreed to give up his 190 Million Pounds over to NCA hence allowing them to return the money back to the state where it came from which is Pakistan. NCA would have needed details/approval from Pak on where to send the money and they did straight to Supreme Court.",7,1,1684318266.0

In anycase, won't it make more sense to investigate Malik Riaz himself rather than IK?",8,1,1684334949.0
jkid5cw,t1_jki8fep,"You just said that the government was not involved. This article proves that wrong by stating that the gov was part of the deal.   
This is some clever legal speak, the ""civil debt"" that they mention is actually a fine that was imposed on Malik Riaz by SC against the Malir Bahria Town Case for landgrabbing.

And as the article clearly states that the gov was part of the deal, it makes sense why the payment was made to SC instead. Without the gov's approval the NCA would not have sent it to SC, which was my entire point.  
NCA returns all the funds back to the state, not the party that they caught those funds from. If the state cuts a deal and decides it wants to give that person extra favors then that's on the state, not on NCA.",9,1,1684336836.0
jkigcn2,t1_jkid5cw,"So, there are several assumptions you're making.  


1) That the NCA was going to deposit it in the Govt of Pakistan's treasury, that is a huge leap of judgement. The matter would have inevitable gone to court in the UK, where the govt of Pakistan would have to spend large sums of money and years for a chance at *maybe* recovering the money. Which is why you'll note the phrase ""that the settlement does not represent a finding of guilt.""  


2) While IK handed out a ""huge favor"" to Malik Riaz. He himself got nothing in return. IK and his wife are trustees of the Al-Qadir trust, they are not beneficial owners. Malik Riaz is known to give such plots of land, another such is Bilawal house in Lahore which as you'll note has never been centre of much controversy.  


3) Even if there is some wrong-doing, how do you establish it through inquiry of just one of the parties i.e IK? Why is Malik Riaz completely absent from all this? An impartial investigation would be welcome, but as is this case is completely baloney and just another avenue of political persecution.",1,1,1684338082.0
jkigzzl,t1_jkid5cw,"Also the govt approved the deal, but it was not part of the settlement itself is what I meant i.e gave NOC. Hence it could not have influenced the deal.",1,1,1684338336.0

jkmh975,t1_jkigcn2,"**""The matter would have inevitable gone to court in the UK, where the govt of Pakistan would have to spend large sums of money and years for a chance at maybe recovering the money.""**   
Gov of Pakistan would have spent no money whatsoever if the case went forward as the NCA was prosecuting it. NCA is a UK Gov backed agency. Malik Riaz on the other hand would've had to spend litigation fees and might even have had to pay more fines as a result of a ""liable"" verdict which was highly likely. An assumption sure but considering the settlement, an apt one.  
*""There is a general principle that a party that loses a civil case will pay the other party’s costs. Civil litigants therefore need to exercise caution in deciding which cases to take to court. "" -* Taken directly from NCA's website.  
So Malik Riaz in the case of a liable verdict would've most likely paid for NCAs attorney fees too.  
*“The size of funds in this case is a step change from previous efforts and shows the importance of changes introduced by the Criminal Finances Act 2017. Although there is scant information about the specifics of the case, returning seized funds to the country of origin, as is proposed, is an obligation under the UN convention against corruption.” -* Duncan Hames ( Director of Policy at Transparency International UK ) commenting on this very case https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/dec/03/pakistani-tycoon-malik-riaz-hussain-hands-over-pounds-190m-to-uk-authorities-nca-

The recovered assets are returned to the state. **""That the NCA was going to deposit it in the Govt of Pakistan's treasury, that is a huge leap of judgement.""** Check the asset recovery section of [https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/corruption/convention-highlights.html](https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/corruption/convention-highlights.html) to confirm that the recovered assets are indeed returned to the state. I am not making any leaps in my judgement here, this is all well established. UK is a UN signatory, them not following this convention and handing Malik Riaz the money that they caught from him are leaps of judgment and logic.  
As for your assertion that this case is **baloney.** I have clearly indicated above how it is not. NCA is bound by UN conventions to send money to the state. Pak Gov made a deal with Malik Riaz and signed an NDA (Kingsley Napley have confirmed it) with the NCA. The money was then transferred straight to the SC as part of the fine imposed on Malik Riaz. So it's clear that the Pak Gov, Imran Khan to be specific, handed out this huge favour to Malik Riaz.  


And the arguments about Imran receiving or not receiving any benefit is beside the point.  He abused his power and allowed money that was owned by Pak to be used against a fine imposed on a corrupt land grabber Malik Riaz. Maybe the benefit was future support ? just because you can not establish an immediate benefit ( I don't know enough about Al Qadir to say anything) doesn't mean there wasn't an expectation of one or that there wasn't any wrong doing.  


Since this is getting way too long, Malik Riaz's gifts to other people like Bilawal have never been directly connected to such favors handed out to him. Again, i do not know the complete details of Al Qadir so i can not comment on that but a favor was handed out which is blatantly obvious considering all the facts.   
Malik Riaz is absent because he is not the one that abused his power to give someone a favor like this. Imran was the PM, he got that NDA approved by the cabinet. He abused his power. His SSPM Shahzad Akbar was directly involved and even spotted having meetings Riaz and Co in London.  
Malik Riaz should be investigated for having laundered/black money in UK and  for the alleged bribe he handed out in the form of a ""Al Qadir"" trust. I agree that Imran is being sinlged out and being victimised on this case but the case is legit.",2,1,1684411183.0
jkn17ad,t1_jkmh975,"Yaar this is getting way to long. I honestly see where you're coming from, and if I were in a civilized country I too would be pissed. Problem is we live in Pakistan, though I'm yet to see anything in written the case has never been about why IK returned the money to Malik Riaz and granted him this favor. Something that I would indeed like a deeper inquiry into.

It has always been focused on IK taking the Al-Qadir trust as kickback from Malik Riaz, which as I said is baloney because it does not matter. He is a trustee and not a beneficial owner. Hence they've never felt the need to call Malik Riaz in for inquiry.  

You can tell because the subject of investigation is Bushra bibi along with IK, and not Malik Riaz. What does Bushra bibi have to do with govt affairs? nothing, it's just a means of humiliating IK by focusing on the non-issue of Al-Qadir trust.


>Maybe the benefit was future support ? just because you can not   
establish an immediate benefit ( I don't know enough about Al Qadir to   
say anything) doesn't mean there wasn't an expectation of one or that   
there wasn't any wrong doing.  


That is indeed a morally grey area but it is not illegal, Bilawal house lahore is well known on the other hand was a gift for the ""support"" that PPP gave Malik Riaz in acquiring the land for Bahria town khi. I'd rather give IK benefit of the doubt for the time being rather than support ppp.

Also, I'm not intimately familiar with how the NCA operates, but I can not imagine that it would be merely be out of the goodness of their heart. If the NCA loses its case will the UK govt simply pick up the tab and Pakistan will just move on? I don't think it's ever as simple as that.",3,1,1684420326.0
