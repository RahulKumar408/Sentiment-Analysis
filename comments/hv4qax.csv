fytlcg1,t3_hv4qax,"It's all a matter of perspective. You can see this as a con, or you can see it as overseas Pakistanis taking a very active role in trying to stay connected and have meaningful discussions. 

We often see people bringing up overseas Pakistanis in an attempt to somehow segregate them from locals,  but please explain how this is an improvement? There's already a flair, but to me it seems like a 'divide and conquer' kind of thing. It's creating a separation where it need not be. 

Pakistan is not a static environment where the traditions and customs are in some type of sandbox. Pakistani culture is changing so fast that anything you may call a tradition can be challenged. Fight back by maintaining your own customs for as long as you can,  but don't fool yourself by thinking Pakistan is not just changing, but has already changed drastically. Its not good or bad,  it just is. And so I don't think local opinions are any more valid or valuable unless you can show how overseas interference is causing a disruption or degradation of the discussion. 

So if you can,  please explain what the reddit community gains by having a higher proportion of locals.

fyrsuv0,t1_fyrs27a,"It's not intuitive to leave your home country and give it nothing in return, saying ""muh government neglects us"" is a terrible and childish excuse. If the government truly neglected the country then Pakistan would be a failed state. However, there are many selfish people in government who only serve themselves, just like the people who leave forever. We are the only ones who can actually do something about it and whining like little children in a candy shop isn't going to do anyone justice. If you see something wrong, do something about it! Sewers overflowing? Report it! And if nothing is still done about it, you try to spread awareness of what's happening. The little things matter A LOT and will eventually lead to reform in the government, as long as we're ready to combat the social problems that lie ahead such as corruption and ""finding the easy way out"" in everything.",5,1,1595344289.0

Ofc they would like stuff like naan and kebabs, but they don't have a liking to anything else, roti, saag, korma etc... The ""Indian"" ones that I am referring to have lived their entire lives in a western country and have never been to Pakistan, they end up learning about the subcontinent through Bollywood films, the number of people like that is too damn high. If you go onto social media and look at Pakistanis that wan't dancing Bollywood style weddings, the people that want Pakistan to give up Kashmir, etc... is too high.

fyrn4in,t1_fyrlrb2,"> Pakistanis that want dancing Bollywood style weddings

I take it you've never been to weddings in Karachi or parts of Punjab.

Pakistan is a very diverse place with a lot of sub-cultures. A lot of our culture is the same as central India... because it literally was the same place not that long ago.

It really looks like you think your view of Pakistan or of the people you know, is what's common.

Also to keep in mind, a big majority of overseas Pakistanis live in the middle east. Who still hold **only** Pakistani passports, even if they have been there since birth and only visit Pakistan once every few years.",6,1,1595341233.0
