itimfjg,t3_ybue7r,"Arshad Sharif‚Äôs father Muhammad Sharif was a commander in the Pakistan Navy. He was awarded the Medal of Distinction for his bravery and services. He died of a heart attack in 2011. Arshad‚Äôs brother Major Ashraf Sharif was stationed in Bannu at that time. Upon hearing the news of his father‚Äôs death, he left Bannu Cantt and was on his way to the funeral but his car drowned as it was attacked by the banned TTP. 

Major Ashraf Sharif was martyred in this attack. He was only 35 years old.

On the one hand, while the preparations for the funeral of Arshad Sharif‚Äôs father were going on, the news of his brother‚Äôs martyrdom also came, after which two funerals took place on the same day from the same house.

Arshad Sharif was living in exile and was one of the finest investigative journalist.

He recently reported on the FIA Shehbaz Sharif case and the murder of Dr. Rizwan. He always conducted thorough investigation and presented people with tangible proof of corruption.

He went into self-exile and launched a YouTube channel. He was passionate about his job his upcoming TV show was about to go on air on BOL TV.

ARY didn't stand with him when they got pressurised from establishment to remove him from channel.

He wasn't willing to go abroad but his family forced him to go as there were serious death threats about him.

He was shot in the head while he was travelling in the car in Kenya according to the latest news reports.

This was a well-executed assassination since the Kenyan police are known as the ""death squad"" because clients from other countries hire them to kill the targets they desire, and four foreigners have recently been murdered in Kenya in this manner.

He might have travelled to Kenya to visit his investigative journalist [friend](https://imgur.com/a/o5U0rJT) there with whom he was collaborating on the documentary ""behind closed doors.""
